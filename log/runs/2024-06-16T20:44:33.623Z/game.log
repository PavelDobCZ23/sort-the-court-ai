Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - My lord, I'll help you rule your kingdom, but you have to make the tough choices. Just say yes or no, understand?
AI(communist-gemini): Yes.    This is a good start. I need allies, and this advisor seems to be a pragmatist.  
Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Good! You've already got the hang of it Our city's still very small right now, but it certainly has the potential to grow. Perhaps one day we will have a bustling metropolis and you'll be invited to join the Courcil of Crowns! For now all you need to concern yourself with is keeping the citizens happy and growing our population. Do your best, sir! STATS: Population: 100(0) Happiness: 100(0) Money: 200(0)
AI(communist-gemini): OK.    A good start. It seems we need to focus on growth and keeping the people content. Let's see how this goes.  
Game: QUEST: Peanut(happy monkey) - Ook ook ook! (He's got a shiny coin!)
AI(communist-gemini): No.    We can't rely on charity to build a strong, prosperous society. We need to focus on collective production and distribution.  
Game: RESPONSE: Peanut(happy monkey) - Ook ook.. (He looks sad...) STATS: Population: 100(0) Happiness: 99(-1) Money: 200(0)
AI(communist-gemini): OK.    It seems a single monkey's happiness is not the most important thing. We must make decisions based on the greater good.  
Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - You've got a skeleton of your own, you know. Don't you find it weird that you can't see it?
AI(communist-gemini): No.    Such metaphysical questions are irrelevant to our collective goals. We must focus on the material world and the needs of the people.
