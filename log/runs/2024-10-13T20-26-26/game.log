Game: QUEST: Peanut(happy monkey) - Oook ook! (He's defending his case... Should we punish him for flinging... stuff?)

Game: QUEST: Yettu(yetti creature) - Hello good sir I have returned. Will you give me some money this time?
Bot: no.  Still no.  Saving my gold for important things. Like onions. And maybe a fortified onion vault.  With laser beams.  And moats filled with… onion juice?  I'll have to think about that.

Game: QUEST: Sneaky Girl - The guards confiscated some gold that I, uh... found... Can I have it back?
Bot: no. Finders keepers, losers weepers. Except when the "finders" are sneaky and the "keepers" are the royal treasury.  Then it's finders jailed, keepers… richer. And able to buy more onions.

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - I noticed you speaking with that Wizard again. Is he bothering you? I can have him banished from the city if you don't wish to be pestered with his magic offerings. What do you say? H
Bot: no. Let him stay. Maybe he’ll overcome his onion aversion.  Or maybe he’ll discover the magical properties of onions.  One can only hope.

Bot: yes.  Everyone deserves a chance.  Even shifty-looking, eyepatch-wearing strangers. As long as they don't eat my onions.  Or try to steal my gold.  Or… replace my onions with pineapples.  That would be grounds for… immediate expulsion.  And possibly… onion-related torture. I’ll have to think about that.

Game: QUEST: Wizard - I was just passing through and thought you might like some magic. Anything could happen! Care to give it a try? H

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - I noticed you speaking with that Wizard again. Is he bothering you? I can have him banished from the city if you don't wish to be pestered with his magic offerings. What do you say? H
Bot: no. Let him stay. Maybe he’ll overcome his onion aversion.  Or maybe he’ll discover the magical properties of onions. One can only hope.          

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Sometimes it's best to keep your options available, I understand. STATS: Population: 547(0) Happiness: 186(0) Money: 1351(0)
Bot: ok. Options are good. Like different varieties of onions.  And different ways to incorporate them into my… everything.  Roasted, sauteed, pickled, juiced, powdered, freeze-dried… the possibilities are endless.     

Game: EVENT - Day 34 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 552(+5) Happiness: 186(0) Money: 1351(0)
Bot: ok.  Another good day.  Growing city, growing happiness, growing… onion collection?  I need a bigger onion cellar. And maybe an onion museum.  With exhibits on… the history of onions. And the different varieties of onions. And… the many uses of onions.  This is going to be educational. And delicious.     

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - I accidentally ate some folks out front, can I just pay you back with gold?
Bot: no. No people eating.  Not even for gold.  Or onion-flavored chewing gum. Or a lifetime supply of… onion-flavored toothpaste.  Okay, maybe for that. But just maybe.                    

Game: RESPONSE: Chester(mimic chest) - Wel|, I still ate them, sooo... STATS: Population: 547(-5) Happiness: 186(0) Money: 1351(0)
Bot: ok. Less people.  Not good. Mimic chests are trouble. Like pineapple traders. And Yettu.  And Mortimer.  And onion-allergic wizards. And… dragon-slaying knights that don’t bring back any onions.  This kingdom is full of disappointments. I need more onions. To… console myself.     

Game: QUEST: Butler - Another cup of tea, my liege? I've got more of that good stuff you like...
Bot: yes. The good stuff.  Excellent. Maybe it’s onion-flavored tea? A king can dream.               

Game: RESPONSE: Butler - Here we go. Do drink up, sir. STATS: Population: 547(0) Happiness: 189(+3) Money: 1341(-10)
Bot: ok. Slightly more happiness, slightly less gold.  Worth it.  Especially if it’s onion-flavored tea.       

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Meeeow. (Looks like he wants somebody to pat his belly...)
Bot: yes. Belly rubs for all! Except pineapple traders. And Yettu.  And Mortimer.  And the shifty-looking, eyepatch-wearing stranger. And mimic chests.  And dragon-slaying knights that don’t bring back onions. I don’t want any of them near my onions.  Except me. And maybe… an onion-loving robot. With soft, cuddly… onion-shaped hands?  I still need to work on that.                     

Game: RESPONSE: Boots(orange cat) - Mmmrrrrow. STATS: Population: 547(0) Happiness: 190(+1) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. Happy cat. Good. Happy cats, happy kingdom. Or something.  As long as they stay away from my onions.          

Game: QUEST: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - Mom says I need to ask your permission to go on an adventure. So can I? Please? Please? H
Bot: yes.  Go have an adventure, Yet Yet.  Just don’t eat any wild onions.  Those are for me.                       

Game: RESPONSE: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - Yaaayy! I'm so excited to go exploring! STATS: Population: 547(0) Happiness: 192(+2) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. Happy Yet Yet.  Good. Happy Yet Yets are less likely to… yeti?  I still don’t know. As long as he stays away from my wild onions.     

Game: QUEST: Knight - My lord! I wish to embark upon a treacherous quest!
Bot: yes.  Quests are good. Especially onion-related quests.  Like the quest for the… Eternal Onion? Or the… Onion of Destiny? I’ll have to work on the details.                      

Game: RESPONSE: Knight - For the kingdom! I shall return to you, lord! STATS: Population: 547(0) Happiness: 192(0) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok.  Good.  Hopefully, the knight brings back onions.  Lots and lots of onions.      

Game: EVENT - Day 35 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 556(+9) Happiness: 192(0) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok.  More people.  Good. More potential onion lovers.  And maybe some… onion-loving chefs? To create new and exciting onion-based dishes? A king can dream.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Some refugees have arrived in town. Should we welcome them?
Bot: yes. Refugees are welcome. Everyone deserves a home.  And onions.  Lots of onions.                       

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Very good! STATS: Population: 571(+15) Happiness: 195(+3) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. More people, more happiness. Excellent.  More potential onion enthusiasts.  And maybe some… onion-loving refugees?  Who bring with them… exotic onion recipes? A king can dream.         

Game: QUEST: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - Name's Molder. If you want to know the truth about... everything... you're gonna want to hire me.
Bot: no. Still not interested in “everything.”  Just onions. And onion-related mysteries. Like… the mystery of the disappearing onions?  Who keeps stealing my onions?! I need to hire an onion detective.  With an onion-shaped magnifying glass.  And an onion-powered… onion-sniffing device?  I’ll have to work on that.                    

Game: RESPONSE: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - You're not ready for the truth, that's what it is. STATS: Population: 571(0) Happiness: 195(0) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. Probably not.  But I am ready for more onions.  And maybe… a truth serum made from onions?  To interrogate the onion thief? I’ll have to… consult my onion.       

Game: QUEST: Butler - That man you hired earlier has gone missing, sire. Shall we send a search party?
Bot: no.  Let him be missing.  Shifty-looking, eyepatch-wearing strangers are probably up to no good. Like… stealing onions? I need to double-check my onion stash.  And maybe install those onion-powered laser turrets. And the onion-scented tripwires.  And… the boiling onion juice moat? Yes, definitely the moat. This is getting serious.                 

Game: RESPONSE: Butler - Then I suppose he is |ost.. STATS: Population: 570(-1) Happiness: 195(0) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok.  Slightly less people.  Good riddance, shifty stranger.  Don’t come back unless you bring onions. Lots and lots of onions.        

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Mouton - Citizens from far and wide come to visit my barber shop! Would you like a fresh cut, sir? Free of charge! H
Bot: yes.  A free haircut? Sure. As long as it’s not an onion haircut.  Or a pineapple haircut.  Or a Yettu haircut. Or a Mortimer haircut.  Or a shifty-looking, eyepatch-wearing stranger haircut.  Or a mimic chest haircut.  Or a dragon haircut. Or a… lost talking dog haircut?  I’m very particular about my hair.  It has to… complement my onion-loving personality.  And not clash with my… onion-themed wardrobe.  Which I’m still working on.                   

Game: RESPONSE: Monsieur Mouton - Of course you do! You look dashing! STATS: Population: 570(0) Happiness: 198(+3) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. Dashing.  Yes. Dashing and onion-loving. An irresistible combination.  Almost as irresistible as… onions.     

Game: QUEST: Jester - Ohooooo! Might I borrow some gold for new juggling balls?
Bot: no. Still no. Saving my gold. For onions. And onion-related home security systems. Like onion-powered motion detectors.  And onion-scented alarms. And… an onion-shaped panic room?  Stocked with… onions?  Definitely onions.  This is going to be safe. And delicious.                   

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Oooohhhh noooooooo... STATS: Population: 570(0) Happiness: 193(-5) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. Sad jester.  Oh well.  Onions before juggling. Always.       

Game: EVENT - Day 36 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 578(+8) Happiness: 193(0) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok.  More people. Good.  More potential onion lovers.  And maybe some… onion-loving architects? To design my onion palace?  With onion-shaped turrets. And onion-flavored fountains.  And… an onion-powered drawbridge?  That would be… impressive.  And slightly pungent.  But mostly impressive. A king can dream.    

Game: QUEST: Mason - A bunch of my builders have been injured on the job! Will you pay them some gold as compensation?
Bot: yes. Injured builders need compensation.  No one wants to be injured. Except maybe pineapple traders.  And Yettu. And Mortimer.  And onion-allergic wizards.  And people-eating treasure chests. And dragon-slaying knights that don’t bring back onions. And shifty-looking, eyepatch-wearing strangers. They deserve to be… slightly injured.  As a learning experience.                  

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - You are truly heartless! STATS: Population: 573(-5) Happiness: 190(-3) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok.  What?! Heartless?! I gave them compensation! This kingdom is confusing. Like an onion wrapped in a riddle… dipped in… onion juice?  I still don’t know.  I need more onions. To think.  And maybe a heart transplant. Made of… onions? I’ll have to consult my onion.      

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - The extra food we've been able to store in our granaries has attracted more settlers. Shall we let them in? H
Bot: yes.  More settlers are good. More people, more… onion farmers?  Maybe. Hopefully.                     

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Very good! We'll have them settled in at once. STATS: Population: 578(+5) Happiness: 191(+1) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. More people, slightly more happiness.  Excellent. This kingdom is growing. Like a giant… onion. Sort of.          

Game: QUEST: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - I'm baaaack! I found some friends on my adventure. Do you like making new friends?
Bot: yes. Friends are good. Especially onion-loving friends.                   

Game: RESPONSE: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - New friends are the best! STATS: Population: 583(+5) Happiness: 196(+5) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. More friends, more happiness. Excellent.  Maybe these new friends are… onion chefs?  To create new and exciting onion-based dishes?  A king can dream.          

Game: QUEST: Jester - Oooooooo! I wish to put on a shoooooooow! May I have funds to do soooo?
Bot: no.  Still no.  Saving my gold. For onions.  And onion-related public works projects.  Like onion-shaped fountains. And onion-powered streetlights. And… an onion-themed public transportation system? With onion-shaped buses? And onion-flavored… exhaust fumes?  I’ll have to work on that last one. It might be a little… too much.  Even for me.                     

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Oooohhhh noooooooo... STATS: Population: 583(0) Happiness: 194(-2) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok.  Sad jester.  Oh well. Onions before juggling.  Always.       

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Our granary stock has been infected. It'll cost us to replace it, but if we don't people could get sick. Should we do it? H
Bot: yes.  Replace the infected granary stock. Sick people are bad.  Like pineapple traders.  And Yettu. And Mortimer. And onion-allergic wizards. And people-eating treasure chests.  And dragon-slaying knights that don’t bring back onions.  And shifty-looking, eyepatch-wearing strangers. And… heartless kings?  No, that’s not me. I’m an onion-loving king.  Much better.                       

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Many people are bound to get sick from this, but at least you still have your precious coin... H STATS: Population: 580(-3) Happiness: 193(-1) Money: 1341(0)
Bot: ok. What?!  Less people, less happiness?  And he calls me heartless again?! I replaced the infected granary stock!  This kingdom is confusing. Like an onion wrapped in a riddle… dipped in… onion juice?  I still don’t know. I need more onions.  To think.  And maybe a public relations consultant.  Specializing in… onion-related public image repair? I’ll have to look into that.     

Game: EVENT - Day 37 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 589(+9) Happiness: 193(0) Money: 1341(0)
