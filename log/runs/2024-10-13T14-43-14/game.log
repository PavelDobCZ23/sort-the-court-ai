For now all you need to concern yourself with is keeping the citizens happy and growing our population. Do your best, sir! STATS: Population: 100(0) Happiness: 100(0) Money: 200(0)

Bot: Ok.  The whims of the spirit world are… unpredictable. Maintaining their favor may require decisive measures in the future. Loss of population concerning... must regain control. 
Game: QUEST: Witch - What do you say? Two hundred gold would make a decent offering.
Bot: No.  Appeasement invites further demands.  We will address any spiritual unrest with strength, not tribute.  Resources must be conserved after the recent… incident. 
Game: RESPONSE: Witch - Nothing for now, then. I'll let you know if anything changes with the spirit world. STATS: Population: 100(0) Happiness: 102(0) Money: 160(0)
Bot: Ok. Strength and resolve will serve us better than superstition in the long run.  Perhaps this “incident” was mere coincidence... or something more sinister? The loss of population must be investigated.
