Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - My lord, I'll help you rule your kingdom, but you have to make the tough choices. Just say yes or no, understand? H
Bot: Yes.  Sounds good to me, advisor. Let's get to work. Folks depend on us. 

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Good! You've already got the hang of it. Our city's still very small right now, but it certainly has the potential to grow. Perhaps one day we will have a bustling metropolis and you'll be invited to join the Council of Crowns! H For now all you need to concern yourself with is keeping the citizens happy and growing our population. H Do your best, sir! STATS: Population: 100(0) Happiness: 100(0) Money: 200(0)
Bot: ok.  A good start.  Reminds me of Scranton, just a bit… smaller.  Gotta keep those folks happy.

Bot: ok. Happy to help, and every new citizen makes our kingdom stronger. 

Game: QUEST: Pancake(black cat) - Mew. (This cat seems slightly magical. Not sure what it wants, though...)
Bot: Yes.  (I like cats.  Hope this one isn't looking for trouble.  Never can tell with these magical creatures. Let's see...) 

Game: RESPONSE: Pancake(black cat) - Mrow! (I guess that's good?) STATS: Population: 101(0) Happiness: 104(+1) Money: 197(0)
Bot: ok.  Seems like the cat approves.  That's good.   

Game: QUEST: Chicken - Bokbokbok.. BOK! (I think it's just here to pay a visit. Should we leave it be?)

Game: RESPONSE: Chicken - Bok. (It left behind an egg!!) STATS: Population: 101(0) Happiness: 104(0) Money: 200(+3)
Bot: ok.  Well, isn't that a pleasant surprise!  Every little bit helps.  A fresh egg, just what I needed.

Bot: ok. Glad to have them.  More folks means a stronger kingdom.  Hope they settle in well. 

Game: QUEST: Georgie(small flying devil) - Hey bud, care to flip a coin with me? Heads, I give you a buncha gold. Tails, I take a bunch of yer people's souls. H

Game: RESPONSE: Georgie(small flying devil) - Ehh, I'll getcha next time, buddy. STATS: Population: 120(0) Happiness: 113(0) Money: 200(0)
Bot: ok.  Good riddance.  Some things are more important than gold.   

Game: QUEST: Butler - My liege, there is a man in the foyer asking to join your guard. He's got an eyepatch, looks a little shifty. H What do you think, should we take a chance on this stranger?
Bot: Yes. Everyone deserves a second chance.  Maybe he's a war hero.  We can use someone who looks tough. Besides,  we need good people to protect our kingdom.   

Game: RESPONSE: Butler - Indeed, more swords will help us. STATS: Population: 121(+1) Happiness: 113(0) Money: 200(0)
Bot: ok. Good. We could use more protection around here.  Hope he’s a good guy. 

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Citizens say a monkey has been running around flinging.. stuff... at them. Should we put out a bounty on it? H
Bot: Yes.  We need to keep order in our kingdom.  Monkeys flinging stuff is not conducive to a peaceful society.   

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - We'll have that monkey captured in no time. STATS: Population: 121(0) Happiness: 114(+1) Money: 170(-30)
Bot: ok.  Worth the cost.  Sometimes you have to spend money to maintain order and peace.   

Game: QUEST: Chicken - Bok bok! (It's running wild! Should we try to capture it?)
Bot: Yes.  A wild chicken, huh? Might as well catch it. We can always use more eggs, or maybe even some chicken pot pie. 

Game: RESPONSE: Chicken - BOK BOK! (Whoa, this thing is dangerous!) STATS: Population: 120(-1) Happiness: 114(0) Money: 170(0)
Bot: ok.  Lost a citizen to a chicken?  That's...unexpected.  Note to self: Chickens can be dangerous.  We need to be more careful. 

Game: EVENT - Day 2 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 130(+10) Happiness: 114(0) Money: 170(0)
Bot: ok.  A decent day, despite the chicken incident.  We're growing, and that's what matters.  Need to keep an eye on the money though. 

Game: QUEST: Fisherman - My boat's too tiny to catch many fish. Can I have some gold to upgrade it? I'll pay you back, I swear_. H
Bot: Yes. We need to invest in our people.  A bigger boat means more fish, which means more food for everyone.  It’s a win-win. 

Game: RESPONSE: Fisherman - Oooh you won't regret this! You'll see! STATS: Population: 130(0) Happiness: 117(+3) Money: 70(-100)
Bot: ok.  Hope he’s right about that.  Money's getting tight.  Need to find a way to boost our treasury. 

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - The people have started a petition to ban pineapples in the city. Should we do it?
Bot: No.  Banning pineapples seems a little extreme.  Let people eat what they want, as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.  Freedom of choice is important.    

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Sticking up for pineapples? How admirable. STATS: Population: 130(0) Happiness: 115(-2) Money: 70(0)
Bot: ok.   Not everyone agrees with me, it seems.  But I stand by my decision.  It's a matter of principle. 

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Hello friend. Care to gaze into my magical vampire crystal?
Bot: Yes. Sure, why not? A little magic never hurt anyone, right?   

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - I see... fame and fortune for you! STATS: Population: 130(0) Happiness: 120(+5) Money: 120(+50)
Bot: ok.  Well, that’s good news!  Fame and fortune, just what this kingdom needs.   

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Good day sir. Do you require any haunting services? For a small price I'll scare some people for you. H
Bot: No.  Scaring people isn't my style.  We want a happy kingdom, not a haunted one.     

Game: RESPONSE: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Very well, very well. STATS: Population: 130(0) Happiness: 120(0) Money: 120(0)
Bot: ok. Glad he understood.  There are better ways to have fun than scaring folks. 

Game: QUEST: Wizard - Have you seen my magical cat, Pancake?
Bot: Yes.  (I think I saw a black cat earlier.  Could that be it?)   

Game: RESPONSE: Wizard - Oh very good, I knew he was around here somewhere! STATS: Population: 130(0) Happiness: 122(+2) Money: 120(0)

Game: QUEST: Butler - That man you hired earlier has gone missing, sire. Shall we send a search party?
Bot: Yes.  Of course.  We need to look out for our people, even the shifty-eyed ones.    

Game: RESPONSE: Butler - We must find him at all costs! STATS: Population: 141(-1) Happiness: 122(0) Money: 110(-10)
Bot: ok.  Hope they find him soon.  Losing people is never good.   

Game: QUEST: Military General - We've captured some foes on the battlefield. Shall we bring them home and put them to work? H
Bot: Yes.  Give them a chance to contribute to our kingdom.  Hard work builds character.  Maybe they'll even become loyal citizens.     

Game: RESPONSE: Military General - We'll get them into town, then. STATS: Population: 149(+8) Happiness: 122(0) Money: 110(0)
Bot: ok. Good.  More hands to help build our kingdom. 

Game: EVENT: Royal Advisor - That mischievous monkey has been captured. I shall send him in for your judgement. H STATS: Population: 149(0) Happiness: 122(0) Money: 110(0)
Bot: ok.  Let's see what this monkey's all about. 

Game: QUEST: Peanut(happy monkey) - Oook ook! (He's defending his case... Should we punish him for flinging... stuff?)
Bot: No.  Let's give him a second chance. Maybe we can find him a job where he can put his flinging skills to good use.  Perhaps delivering messages?   

Game: RESPONSE: Peanut(happy monkey) - Ook ookook! (You better not do it again, though...) STATS: Population: 149(0) Happiness: 124(+2) Money: 110(0)
Bot: ok. Glad we could resolve that peacefully. Everyone deserves a chance to redeem themselves.  Even a monkey. 

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - There's a petition going around to open our borders to the neighbouring town. What do you say?
Bot: Yes. Open borders promote trade and understanding. Let's be good neighbors.  It’s the right thing to do.     

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Together our towns will grow stronger! STATS: Population: 179(+30) Happiness: 134(+10) Money: 160(+50)
Bot: ok. Excellent. This is just what we needed. Growth, happiness, and a boost to our treasury.  Win-win-win. 

Game: QUEST: Yettu(yetti creature) - I would like some money please.
Bot: No.  We can't just give money away to everyone who asks.  We have a kingdom to run, and resources are limited.  Perhaps we can offer him a job instead?    

Game: RESPONSE: Yettu(yetti creature) - Fine then. I shall return another day. STATS: Population: 179(0) Happiness: 133(-1) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok.  Hope he understands. We have to be responsible with our finances.  We can’t just hand out money. 

Game: EVENT - Day 4 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 196(+17) Happiness: 133(0) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok.  Another good day.  Growing steadily. We're doing well. 

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Hello friend. Care to gaze into my magical vampire crystal?
Bot: Yes.  A little peek into the future never hurts.  Besides, it worked out well last time. 

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - I see... death, and misery! STATS: Population: 181(-15) Happiness: 118(-15) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok. Uh oh.  That's… concerning. We need to be extra careful.  This isn’t good.  We need to turn things around. 

Game: QUEST: Winston(large green slimy creature) - Hey uhhhh, you think you could tell people to stoooop callin' me "slimeball"? It's hurtin' my feeeelings.. H
Bot: Yes.  Of course.  We should treat everyone with respect.  No name-calling.  It’s simple human decency.    

Game: RESPONSE: Winston(large green slimy creature) -  STATS: Population: 181(0) Happiness: 115(-3) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok. Hmm, that didn't seem to help much.  Maybe there's more to it than just the name-calling.  We'll need to look into this.  Something's not right. 

Game: QUEST: Sneaky Girl - Want me to steal from the rich and give to... you? Not just the rich, I'll steal from whoever, basically. H
Bot: No. Stealing is wrong. We don't need to resort to illegal activities. We'll find honest ways to improve our kingdom's finances. 

Game: RESPONSE: Sneaky Girl - Taking the high road, huh? I'll see you around. STATS: Population: 181(0) Happiness: 115(0) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok.  Glad she's gone.  We need to set a good example. Honesty is the best policy. 

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - You feelin' spooky today?
Bot: No.  Not particularly. I'm more focused on improving our kingdom and ensuring the well-being of our citizens. Spookiness can wait. 

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Not even a tiny spook? Little baby bat? STATS: Population: 181(0) Happiness: 115(0) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok.  Nope, no spookiness today.  We have serious work to do. 

Game: QUEST: Mason - Could I trouble you for a sandwich? Surely the cost of one sandwich is nothing to a great king like you.
Bot: Yes. Of course.  No one should go hungry. A sandwich is a small price to pay for someone's well-being.  Reminds me of when I… well, never mind.    

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - So stingy! STATS: Population: 181(0) Happiness: 114(-1) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok.  That's... ungrateful.  I try to be generous, but it seems some people are never satisfied.  Can't please everyone, I guess. 

Game: EVENT - Day 5 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 188(+7) Happiness: 114(0) Money: 160(0)
Bot: ok.  A small increase in population.  We're not growing as fast as we were, and happiness is down.  Need to focus on turning things around.  We need to address those ominous predictions. 

Game: QUEST: Grandma - Eeeh, hello sonny. Can I borrow a coin for the newspaper?
Bot: Yes.  Of course, ma'am.  Here you go.  Keeping informed is important, especially at times like these.

Bot: ok. Happy to help.  Every little bit helps.   

Game: QUEST: Blacksmith - I'm a blacksmith and I'd like to set up shop here. I can pay my own way, I just need your permission. What do you say? H

Game: RESPONSE: Pancake(black cat) - Mrow! (I guess we are!) STATS: Population: 191(0) Happiness: 118(+1) Money: 159(0)

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - I'm hungry. Can I eat some folks? I've got plenty of gold, so I can pay you back for their... lives... H
Bot: No. Absolutely not.  We don't allow anyone to eat our citizens, no matter how much gold they offer.  That’s not how we do things around here.    

Game: RESPONSE: Chester(mimic chest) - Ah, fine, I'll leave them alone. STATS: Population: 205(0) Happiness: 124(+1) Money: 149(0)
Bot: ok. Glad to hear it.  Some things are more important than gold.  Like human lives.   

Game: QUEST: Jester - Oooooooo! I wish to put on a shoooooooow! May I have funds to do soooo?

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Ooooooooohohoho! Very gooooood! STATS: Population: 205(0) Happiness: 124(0) Money: 99(-50)
Bot: ok. Hope it’s a good show.  We need a boost in morale.  But we’re running low on funds again.  Need to address that.    

Game: QUEST: Knight - My lord! I wish to embark upon a treacherous quest!

Bot: ok. Excellent growth and happiness is up significantly. This is great progress.  But we still need to find a way to increase our funds. 

Game: QUEST: Wizard - I was just passing through and thought you might like some magic. Anything could happen! Care to give it a try? H
Bot: Yes. Sure, why not. A little magic could be just what we need to boost our fortunes.  Besides, I’m feeling lucky.

Game: QUEST: Petite Souris(tiny mouse) - Squee! (There's a mouse! Should we chase it away?)

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - There's a very stinky kid running around the streets. Should we force her to have a bath? H
Bot: No.  We shouldn’t force anyone to do anything against their will.  Maybe we can offer her some nice-smelling soap as a gift.  A little kindness can go a long way.  We need to get that happiness level back up.      

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I wonder if she'll ever stop running around.. STATS: Population: 236(0) Happiness: 142(+101) Money: 299(0)
Bot: ok.  Well, that was a rollercoaster.  Glad to see happiness rebounding.  We dodged a bullet there.  Maybe kindness *is* the answer.   

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Meeeow. (Looks like he wants somebody to pat his belly...)

Bot: ok. Another good day.  Solid growth, happiness is stable, and our finances are improving. We’re on the right track. 

Game: EVENT: Royal Advisor - Sir, the city's population is growing steadily. Our records of citizenship indicate that 250 people now call the city home. With a bigger city, we'll need to maintain even higher happiness in order to keep people satisfied. H Make sure you pay attention to the citizens and their issues to raise our happiness! H Anyway, we still have lots of work to do. Let's make this city even bigger! By the way, remember earlier when I mentioned the Council of Crowns? I've heard a rumor that one of their members has been searching the land for a new ruler to join them. H Perhaps they are aware of our progress... STATS: Population: 256(0) Happiness: 143(0) Money: 419(+100)
Bot: ok.  This is excellent news.  We’re making real progress.  The Council of Crowns, huh?  That’s… something to think about.  We need to keep up the good work. Focus on the people, and keep building our kingdom. 

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Mrow. (Can I have some food?)
Bot: Yes. Of course, kitty. Here you go.  *Gives the cat some food*  No one should go hungry.      

Game: RESPONSE: Boots(orange cat) - Mrrrrrow. STATS: Population: 256(0) Happiness: 142(-1) Money: 421(+2)
Bot: ok.  Huh.  Happiness went *down* after I fed the cat?  That’s… odd.  I thought a little kindness would boost morale.  Maybe I'm overthinking it.     

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - I'm the Duke of Spook! Do you want a spooky nickname?
Bot: No.  I'm good, thanks.  "Joe" is spooky enough.  Besides, we have more important things to worry about than spooky nicknames.       

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Aw, man... You're no fun. STATS: Population: 256(0) Happiness: 41(-101) Money: 421(0)
Bot: ok.  Whoa!  Another massive drop in happiness.  What is going on? This "Duke of Spook" seems to have a strange effect on our kingdom's morale.  We need to figure this out. This is a serious issue. We need to be much more cautious about these... supernatural encounters.  They are messing around with us. 

Game: EVENT: Fisherman - My boat's all fixed up thanks to you! It's about time I started paying you back for your loan! H STATS: Population: 256(0) Happiness: 41(0) Money: 52(-369)
Bot: ok.  Well, that's good, I guess. But we just took a huge hit to our finances. We need to find a way to generate more income, and quickly. This is not good.  That drop in happiness and now this... we're in trouble.   

Game: QUEST: Mason - I'd like to build a new granary. This could help expand our population, but it'll cost a bit!
Bot: Yes. We need to invest in our infrastructure to support growth. A granary is a good investment, even if it's expensive.  Hopefully it pays for itself soon and get us out of red numbers.  

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - You got it, this will help our city grow! STATS: Population: 263(+7) Happiness: 41(0) Money: 451(+399)
Bot: ok. Good. Glad to see our finances recovering. We need to keep making smart investments like this.  That granary should help boost our population too.   

Game: EVENT - Day 9 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 264(+1) Happiness: 41(0) Money: 451(0)
Bot: ok. Slow growth, and happiness is still alarmingly low.  We need to address this.  Something is seriously affecting our people's morale, and we need to figure out what it is.  Maybe it’s time to compromise on some of my principles.  The situation calls for flexibility. 

Game: QUEST: Wizard - I was just passing through and thought you might like some magic. Anything could happen! Care to give it a try? H
Bot: No.  I think I'll pass this time.  Magic has been a bit too unpredictable lately.  We need stability, not more chaos.    

Game: RESPONSE: Wizard - I see, it's understandable that you don't want to take the risk. Farewell. STATS: Population: 264(0) Happiness: 41(0) Money: 451(0)
Bot: ok.  Good. We need to be more careful.  Magic is too risky right now. We need to focus on more practical solutions.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Some villagers are threatening to leave unless we pay them a sum of gold. Should we listen to their demands? H
Bot: No.  We can't give in to extortion.  It sets a bad precedent. We need to find a way to address their concerns without paying them off.  There must be something else we can offer them.       

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I see. We'll let them go, then. STATS: Population: 258(-6) Happiness: 41(0) Money: 451(0)
Bot: ok.  Losing citizens is not ideal. But we can't let people bully us into paying them. We need to find a way to improve happiness without resorting to bribery. This is a challenge.   

Game: QUEST: Witch - There's a buncha goblins in the lower quarter. I'll slay 'em for a few gold coins if you want. H
Bot: Yes. We need to protect our citizens, even if it costs us.  Goblins are a menace.       

Game: RESPONSE: Witch - I'll show those creeps! STATS: Population: 258(0) Happiness: 145(+104) Money: 441(-10)
Bot: ok. Good. Glad to have her help.  That boost to happiness is most welcome.  Seems like dealing with threats directly is a good strategy.  We need to remember that.    

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - You've got a skeleton of your own, you know. Don't you find it weird that you can' see it?
Bot: Yes. (Everyone has a skeleton, I guess. It *is* a little weird that we can't see them.  Maybe it's better that way.)     

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Yeah, it's pretty weird. Don't think about it too much. STATS: Population: 258(0) Happiness: 145(0) Money: 441(0)
Bot: ok.  Good advice.  Some things are best left unpondered.   

Game: QUEST: Pancake(black cat) - Mew. (It's that slightly magical cat from before. Does this mean we're friends now?)
Bot: Yes.  We’re friends.  Cats are good.  Especially slightly magical ones.       

Game: RESPONSE: Pancake(black cat) - Mrow! (I guess we are!) STATS: Population: 258(0) Happiness: 146(+1) Money: 441(0)
Bot: ok. Good. Glad to have a feline friend. Even a magical one. Every little bit helps.     

Game: EVENT: Gossip is spreading about a heroic purple witch slaying goblins in the lower quarter. She's become something of a folk hero! STATS: Population: 258(0) Happiness: 151(+5) Money: 441(0)
Bot: ok. That's good to hear. We need heroes.  Especially ones who can deal with goblins.  She deserves a medal or something.    

Game: EVENT - Day 10 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 262(+4) Happiness: 151(0) Money: 441(0)
Bot: ok. Steady progress. Happiness is up. We're doing well.  But we can't be complacent.  We need to keep working to improve our kingdom. 

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Meeeow. (Looks like he wants somebody to pat his belly...)
Bot: Yes. *Pats the cat's belly gently* Who's a good kitty?  We need to keep up the positive energy.      

Game: RESPONSE: Boots(orange cat) - Mmmrrrrow. STATS: Population: 262(0) Happiness: 152(+1) Money: 441(0)
Bot: ok.  Good kitty.  Every little bit helps.  Even a purring cat can improve morale.    

Game: QUEST: Mortimer - Hum yes hello. One of your fishermen has been bothering me. I demand a villager as, ummm, a sacrifice. Yes.
Bot: No. Absolutely not.  We do not sacrifice our citizens.  That is barbaric.  We need to protect our people, not offer them up to… whatever this Mortimer is.       

Game: RESPONSE: Mortimer - Hohoho hum! You've angered me now, sir! Watch your back... STATS: Population: 262(0) Happiness: 152(0) Money: 441(0)
Bot: ok.  We can't be intimidated.  We'll deal with this Mortimer if he causes any trouble.  We need to stand up for what’s right.    

Game: QUEST: The Sultan - How about this... Give me 200 gold, and I'l provide a large shipment of luxury goods.
Bot: Yes.  This sounds like a good investment.  Luxury goods can improve our citizens' quality of life and boost our economy. It's a bit of a gamble, but we can afford it.  Hopefully, this pays off.     

Game: RESPONSE: The Sultan - Quite agreeable! We shall work together again, I hope! STATS: Population: 262(0) Happiness: 177(+25) Money: 241(-200)
Bot: ok. That’s a significant boost to happiness.  And a significant hit to our treasury.  Hope those luxury goods are worth it.  We need to keep a close eye on our finances.      

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - My lord, a man wishes to settle a dispute. He says he is way cool, but his friend says he is not. Do you think he is cool? H
Bot: Yes.  Everyone deserves to be considered cool.  Let’s give this guy the benefit of the doubt. Positivity is important. We need more of that in our kingdom.         

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that. STATS: Population: 262(0) Happiness: 178(+1) Money: 241(0)
Bot: ok. Good.  A little validation can go a long way.  Glad we could resolve this dispute peacefully. Every little bit helps.     

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - I'm the Duke of Spook! Do you want a spooky nickname?
Bot: No.  Still no. "Joe" is just fine. We have more important things to focus on than spooky nicknames. We need to be careful around this Duke of Spook. He seems to have a negative effect on our happiness levels.       

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Aw, man... You're no fun. STATS: Population: 262(0) Happiness: 177(-1) Money: 241(0)
Bot: ok.  That’s a small drop in happiness, but a drop nonetheless. We need to keep our distance from this "Duke of Spook."  He’s trouble. 

Game: EVENT - Day 11 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 279(+17) Happiness: 177(0) Money: 241(0)
Bot: ok.  Good growth, happiness is stable. We’re doing alright. But we need to be mindful of our finances. We took a big hit with that luxury goods purchase.  Hopefully it pays off in the long run. 

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Hmph. You call this a castle?
Bot: Yes.  It's our castle, and we're proud of it. It may not be perfect, but it's home.     

Game: RESPONSE: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Indeed, it is! Trick question! STATS: Population: 279(0) Happiness: 178(+1) Money: 241(0)
Bot: ok.  A trick question, huh? Well, I'm glad he approves of our castle. Every little bit helps.    

Game: QUEST: Georgie(small flying devil) - Hey, now here's a deal for you, pal! Give me some of yer people's happiness, I'll hook you up with some gold. Sound good?
Bot: No. Absolutely not. We do not trade happiness for gold.  Happiness is more valuable. We'll find other ways to generate income.       

Game: RESPONSE: Georgie(small flying devil) - Ehh, I'll getcha next time, buddy. STATS: Population: 279(0) Happiness: 178(0) Money: 241(0)
Bot: ok. Good riddance.  Some things are not for sale.     

Game: EVENT: Knight - I have returned from my quest! A great bounty of treasure is ours, my lord! STATS: Population: 279(0) Happiness: 178(0) Money: 491(+250)
Bot: ok.  Excellent!  This is just what we needed.  A much-needed boost to our treasury.  Good work, knight.       

Game: QUEST: Mason - Could I trouble you for a sandwich? Surely the cost of one sandwich is nothing to a great king like you.
Bot: Yes.  Of course. No one should go hungry. A sandwich is a small price to pay.  Especially now that our finances have improved.       

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - So stingy! STATS: Population: 279(0) Happiness: 177(-1) Money: 491(0)
Bot: ok. Ungrateful again.  I can't please everyone, I guess.  At least it was just a small dip in happiness.     

Game: QUEST: Jester - Ohooooo! Might I borrow some gold for new juggling balls?
Bot: Yes.  Invest in our entertainers. They bring joy to our kingdom.  And we can certainly afford it now.         

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Ooooooooohohoho! Very gooooood! STATS: Population: 279(0) Happiness: 182(+5) Money: 481(-10)
Bot: ok.  Good. A small price to pay for increased happiness.  We need to keep our citizens entertained.        

Game: EVENT - Day 12 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 303(+24) Happiness: 182(0) Money: 481(0)
Bot: ok. Excellent growth, and happiness is up. We're doing very well. Our finances are healthy.  Things are looking up.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - A petition to bring the circus to town is circulating. Could attract tourists, are you interested? H
Bot: Yes. A circus could be a great way to boost our economy and entertain our citizens. Let's do it.         

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Let the people have their circus, then! STATS: Population: 313(+10) Happiness: 192(+10) Money: 581(+100)
Bot: ok. Great! This is exactly what we needed. Increased population, happiness, *and* a boost to our treasury.  The circus is a big win.       

Game: QUEST: Winston(large green slimy creature) - Hey uhhhhh, it's sliiiiiime day... Got a preeeesent for meeeee?
Bot: Yes. Sure, why not. A little present might be just what we need to boost morale. Let's see what happens.  We have some room in the budget right now and this guy is not good for our happiness levels.   

Game: RESPONSE: Winston(large green slimy creature) - Yeeeeaaah! You're so niiiiice! STATS: Population: 313(0) Happiness: 194(+2) Money: 576(-5)
Bot: ok.  Good. A small price to pay for a bit more happiness. We need to keep this "slimeball" happy.  He's a bit of a wildcard.    

Game: QUEST: Wizard - I was just passing through and thought you might like some magic. Anything could happen! Care to give it a try? H
Bot: No. I think we'll pass on the magic for now. We've been down that road before, and it's been a bit too unpredictable.  We need stability, not random magical events.      

Game: RESPONSE: Wizard - I see, it's understandable that you don't want to take the risk. Farewell. STATS: Population: 313(0) Happiness: 194(0) Money: 576(0)
Bot: ok. Good. We need to be more careful. We can’t afford any more magical mishaps.  We've been lucky so far, but we can't count on that forever.       

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - I noticed you speaking with that Wizard again. Is he bothering you? I can have him banished from the city if you don't wish to be pestered with his magic offerings. What do you say? H
Bot: No. Banishment is a bit harsh.  He hasn't done anything wrong. Let him be.  We believe in second chances, and besides, he might come in handy someday.  We don’t want to burn bridges.       

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Sometimes it's best to keep your options available, I understand. STATS: Population: 313(0) Happiness: 194(0) Money: 576(0)
Bot: ok. Exactly.  It’s always good to have options.  You never know when a little magic might come in handy.  Better to have him as a friend than an enemy.       

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Any mysteries afoot? I can do some snooping for a small fee if you're interested.. H
Bot: Yes.  We could use some help investigating those strange drops in happiness.  A little snooping might be just what we need to get to the bottom of this.         

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - I'll uncover the truth and report back to you! STATS: Population: 313(0) Happiness: 194(0) Money: 566(-10)
Bot: ok. Good.  I look forward to his report. We need to solve this mystery.  Those happiness fluctuations are a serious concern. 

Game: EVENT: The circus is in town, bringing joy to all those who visit! It also happens to bring in a nice bit of gold... STATS: Population: 313(0) Happiness: 196(+2) Money: 576(+10)
Bot: ok.  The circus continues to be a good investment. Glad to see it’s bringing in both happiness and gold.   

Game: EVENT - Day 13 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 342(+29) Happiness: 196(0) Money: 576(0)
Bot: ok.  Excellent growth!  Happiness is stable, and our finances are healthy. We’re on a roll.  Keep up the good work. 

Game: QUEST: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - Mom says I need to ask your permission to go on an adventure. So can I? Please? Please? H
Bot: Yes.  Of course.  Every young adventurer needs to start somewhere. Let him go.  Encourage the youth, that’s my motto.       

Game: RESPONSE: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - Yaaayy! I'm so excited to go exploring! STATS: Population: 342(0) Happiness: 198(+2) Money: 576(0)
Bot: ok.  Good. A little youthful enthusiasm is always a good thing.  Hope he has a safe and exciting adventure.         

Game: QUEST: Blacksmith - My sales have brought in record profits, and Id like to give you something as thanks. Will you accept my gift? H
Bot: Yes. Of course.  We’re always grateful for the generosity of our citizens.  Especially when it comes in the form of profits.       

Game: RESPONSE: Blacksmith - Very good, very good! STATS: Population: 342(0) Happiness: 198(0) Money: 616(+40)
Bot: ok. Excellent.  Always good to have a thriving business community.  We appreciate the blacksmith's contribution.        

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Reporting in! I figured out a mysterious new way to make gold. Want to know how? H
Bot: Yes.  We’re always open to new ideas for generating income. Let’s hear what he has to say.  Especially from a skeleton who snoops.          

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - I'm not telling you! Hehehe... STATS: Population: 342(0) Happiness: 198(0) Money: 666(+50)
Bot: ok. Well, that’s… interesting. He found a way to make gold but won’t tell us how. At least our treasury benefitted. Mysterious ways indeed.  I guess as long as it’s not illegal…  But I still want to know what he's up to.    

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Hmph. You call this a castle?
Bot: Yes.  It’s our castle, and we’re proud of it. It may not be perfect, but it's our home.  Same answer as last time.  Is he losing his memory?     

Game: RESPONSE: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Indeed, it is! Trick question! STATS: Population: 342(0) Happiness: 199(+1) Money: 666(0)
Bot: ok. Another trick question.  At least he likes our castle.  Maybe he should consider moving in. We have plenty of room.     

Game: QUEST: Louis - It seems your court is without much cake! I can provide cake! I am a cake chef! May I join you? H
Bot: Yes.  Cake is good. Every kingdom needs cake. Let him join.  More cake is always a good thing.  Besides, "cake chef" sounds like a prestigious profession.       

Game: RESPONSE: Louis - Thank you! I am grateful! I am cakeful! I will make you cakes! See you later! STATS: Population: 343(+1) Happiness: 199(0) Money: 666(0)
Bot: ok.  Glad to have him on board.  Cakeful indeed. I look forward to those cakes.  A kingdom needs cake.  It's like… a fundamental principle of good governance.    

Game: EVENT: The circus is in town, bringing joy to all those who visit! It also happens to bring in a nice bit of gold... STATS: Population: 343(0) Happiness: 201(+2) Money: 676(+10)
Bot: ok.  The circus continues to deliver.  Happiness and gold. A winning combination. We should have a circus all the time.      

Game: EVENT - Day 14 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 375(+32) Happiness: 201(0) Money: 676(0)
Bot: ok. Fantastic growth!  Happiness is up, and our finances are solid.  We're doing great! Keep up the good work, everyone!  We're building a strong and prosperous kingdom.  Almost makes me want to…  *clears throat*…  Where was I? Ah yes, ruling a kingdom.  Just like riding a bicycle.  You never forget. 

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - I'm hungry. Can I eat some folks? I've got plenty of gold, so I can pay you back for their... lives... H
Bot: No. Absolutely not. We do not negotiate with… chest-like creatures who eat people. No matter how much gold they offer. Some things are not for sale. Human lives are precious.   

Game: RESPONSE: Chester(mimic chest) - Ah, fine, I'll leave them alone. STATS: Population: 375(0) Happiness: 202(+1) Money: 676(0)
Bot: ok. Good.  Glad he's not going to eat anyone.  We need to keep an eye on that chest, though. Seems like trouble.       

Game: QUEST: Blacksmith - My sales have brought in record profits, and Id like to give you something as thanks. Will you accept my gift? H
Bot: Yes. We gratefully accept. The blacksmith is a valuable member of our community. We appreciate his generosity.     

Game: RESPONSE: Blacksmith - Very good, very good! STATS: Population: 375(0) Happiness: 202(0) Money: 716(+40)
Bot: ok. Excellent. Our treasury is growing nicely. Thanks to the hard work of our citizens. We need to keep supporting our local businesses. They’re the backbone of our economy.     

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Some villagers are threatening to leave unless we pay them a sum of gold. Should we listen to their demands? H
Bot: No. We will not give in to extortion.  We need to find other ways to address their concerns. Paying them off sets a bad precedent. We need to be firm but fair.      

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I see. We'll let them go, then. STATS: Population: 369(-6) Happiness: 202(0) Money: 716(0)
Bot: ok. Losing citizens is not good, but we can't be held hostage by their demands. We need to focus on making our kingdom a place where people *want* to stay, not a place they have to be paid to stay.  We need to improve the quality of life for everyone.    

Game: QUEST: Knight - My lord! I wish to embark upon a treacherous quest!
Bot: Yes.  Go forth, brave knight! We need courageous adventurers to explore the world and bring back riches and glory.  Good luck!         

Game: RESPONSE: Knight - For the kingdom! I shall return to you, lord! STATS: Population: 369(0) Happiness: 202(0) Money: 716(0)
Bot: ok. Godspeed, brave knight. May your quest be successful and your return triumphant.  We eagerly await your return.      

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Mrow. (Can I have some food?)
Bot: Yes.  *Gives the cat some food* Of course, kitty.  Here you go.  No one should go hungry, not even a cat.  Especially not this adorable orange cat.       

Game: RESPONSE: Boots(orange cat) - Mrrrrrow. STATS: Population: 369(0) Happiness: 201(-1) Money: 718(+2)
Bot: ok. Another slight dip in happiness after feeding the cat. I'm starting to think there's a correlation here. Maybe we should limit the cat's food intake.  Or find a way to monetize its purring.  I’m just spitballing here.     

Game: EVENT: The circus has packed up and left town, but not without leaving behind even more gold coins! STATS: Population: 369(0) Happiness: 201(0) Money: 738(+20)
Bot: ok.  The circus is a gift that keeps on giving. Even after they've left.  We should invite them back as soon as possible.  Maybe we can offer them a permanent residence.  A Royal Circus, perhaps?   

Game: EVENT - Day 15 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 402(+33) Happiness: 201(0) Money: 738(0)
Bot: ok.  Excellent growth! Happiness is stable, and our finances are strong. We're doing fantastic.  We're building a truly remarkable kingdom.  Just like… well, you know…  *clears throat*  A great kingdom. That’s what we’re building. A great kingdom.  For the people. By the people.  You get the idea. 

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - I'm the Duke of Spook! Do you want a spooky nickname?
Bot: No. Thanks, but no thanks.  "Joe" is perfectly spooky enough. I'm also a little wary of this Duke of Spook. He seems to have a negative impact on our happiness. We need to keep our distance.  

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Aw, man... You're no fun. STATS: Population: 402(0) Happiness: 200(-1) Money: 738(0)
Bot: ok.  A small dip, but a dip nonetheless.  I knew it. He’s bad news for our morale.  We need to avoid him.  Maybe put up a "No Dukes of Spook Allowed" sign.  Just a thought. 

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - The guild of pineapple traders offers you a gift, sire! Will you accept it?
Bot: Yes.  Of course. We are always grateful for gifts, especially from traders. Pineapples are a delicious and healthy treat.  And who knows, maybe this will lead to a lucrative trade agreement.     

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - They are very happy with your decision about the petition! STATS: Population: 402(0) Happiness: 200(0) Money: 838(+100)
Bot: ok. Good.  Glad to see our decision on the pineapple petition is paying off.  It’s important to stand up for what you believe in, even if it's pineapples.     

Game: QUEST: Mason - Could I trouble you for a sandwich? Surely the cost of one sandwich is nothing to a great king like you.
Bot: No.  I think I’ll pass this time. This mason seems perpetually ungrateful.  We need to be more discerning with our generosity.  Perhaps we should start charging for sandwiches. Just a thought.      

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - So stingy! STATS: Population: 402(0) Happiness: 199(-1) Money: 838(0)
Bot: ok.  See? Ungrateful as always.  We can't please everyone.  We need to focus on those who appreciate our efforts.      

Game: QUEST: Yettu(yetti creature) - Hello good sir I have returned. Will you give me some money this time?
Bot: No.  We still can’t just give money away.  We have a budget to maintain. Perhaps we can offer him a job instead.  We need workers, not freeloaders.        

Game: RESPONSE: Yettu(yetti creature) - Fine then. I shall return another day. STATS: Population: 402(0) Happiness: 198(-1) Money: 838(0)
Bot: ok.  Another small dip in happiness. This yetti is starting to become a nuisance. We need to find a way to discourage him from coming back. Maybe a "No Yettis Allowed" sign.  To go along with the "No Dukes of Spook Allowed" sign.  We’re going to need a bigger signpost.      

Game: QUEST: Peanut(happy monkey) - Ook ook ook! (He's got a shiny coin!)
Bot: Yes.  (Take the coin.  Shiny coins are good.)     

Game: RESPONSE: Peanut(happy monkey) - Okokokokooook! STATS: Population: 402(0) Happiness: 198(0) Money: 843(+5)
Bot: ok.  A shiny coin! Excellent!  Every little bit helps.  Glad to see the monkey is contributing to our economy.  Maybe we should train him to find more shiny coins.  A Royal Coin-Finding Monkey.  It has a certain ring to it.       

Game: EVENT - Day 16 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 432(+30) Happiness: 198(0) Money: 843(0)
Bot: ok.  Great growth!  Happiness is holding steady, and our finances are looking good. We're in a strong position.  We need to keep making smart decisions and investing in our kingdom's future.  Just like… well, you know… *clears throat*  Building a better future. For everyone.  That's what it's all about. 

Game: QUEST: Military General - A nearby town has asked us to form an alliance with them. Should we use them to beef up our ranks? H
Bot: Yes. An alliance could be beneficial.  Strength in numbers.  Let's join forces. It’s always good to have allies, especially in these uncertain times.        

Game: RESPONSE: Military General - Sounds good to me, more swords for us! STATS: Population: 447(+15) Happiness: 198(0) Money: 843(0)
Bot: ok.  Good. More swords are always welcome.  We need to be prepared for anything.  A strong defense is essential for a prosperous kingdom.          

Game: QUEST: Little Timmy - I'm Lil' Timmy! Nice to meetcha! You like ice cweam?
Bot: Yes. Everyone likes ice cream.  It's a classic.  Especially on a hot day.  Reminds me of…  *clears throat*…  Never mind.  Ice cream is good.       

Game: RESPONSE: Little Timmy - Mwwaah! Me toooo! STATS: Population: 447(0) Happiness: 200(+2) Money: 843(0)
Bot: ok. Glad to see a happy child.  Ice cream brings joy to everyone. It's a universal language.  Maybe we should have a Royal Ice Cream Social.  Just a thought.           

Game: QUEST: Grandma - Eeeeeh, I was considering opening up a soup shop. Think it's a good idea? I'd need some gold_.
Bot: Yes.  A soup shop sounds like a good idea.  Everyone likes soup.  Especially on a cold day.  It’s a good investment in our local economy.  Plus, it creates jobs.  And we can afford it.         

Game: RESPONSE: Grandma - Very well! I'll sell my soup in the town square. STATS: Population: 457(+10) Happiness: 205(+5) Money: 793(-50)
Bot: ok.  Good to see more businesses opening up in our kingdom.  And a nice boost to both population and happiness.  Soup is good for the soul.  And the economy.      

Game: QUEST: All—Seeing Eye - (It's just.. staring at me... Does it want something?)
Bot: Yes. (Let's see what it wants. Maybe it needs directions.)       

Game: RESPONSE: All—Seeing Eye - (What just happened? I feel... lucky!) STATS: Population: 457(0) Happiness: 205(0) Money: 893(+100)
Bot: ok.  Well, that was unexpected. A sudden influx of gold.  I guess the All-Seeing Eye likes us.  Maybe it’s a good luck charm.  We should keep it around.    

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Our granary stock has been infected. It'll cost us to replace it, but if we don't people could get sick. Should we do it? H
Bot: Yes.  We need to protect our citizens' health.  Replacing the infected grain is a necessary expense.  We can't risk an outbreak of illness.  It’s the responsible thing to do.         

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Yes, our people's health is worth the cost. STATS: Population: 457(0) Happiness: 206(+1) Money: 823(-70)
Bot: ok.  A small dip in our finances, but it was worth it. We need to prioritize the health and well-being of our people.  That’s what good governance is all about.          

Game: EVENT - Day 17 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 491(+34) Happiness: 206(0) Money: 823(0)
Bot: ok.  Excellent growth! Happiness is up, and our finances are recovering.  We're doing great!  We need to keep up the momentum.  We're building a truly thriving kingdom.  Just like…  *clears throat* … you know…  A great kingdom.  That’s the ticket. 

Game: QUEST: The Sultan - I've got a business proposition for you and your tiny little town. Are you interested?
Bot: Yes. We’re always open to new business opportunities.  Let’s hear what he has to say.  We need to keep our economy growing.      

Game: RESPONSE: The Sultan - Aha, I will bring you details soon... STATS: Population: 491(0) Happiness: 206(0) Money: 823(0)
Bot: ok. I look forward to hearing his proposal.  Hopefully it’s a lucrative deal.  We can use another boost to our treasury.        

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Any mysteries afoot? I can do some snooping for a small fee if you're interested.. H
Bot: Yes.  Let's put him back on the case.  Those fluctuations in happiness are still a concern.  We need to get to the bottom of it.        

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - I'll uncover the truth and report back to you! STATS: Population: 491(0) Happiness: 206(0) Money: 813(-10)
Bot: ok. Good. I eagerly await his findings. We need to solve this mystery.  It’s important to understand what’s affecting our kingdom’s morale.          

Game: QUEST: Dragon - Booo! Give me your gold or I'll eat your townspeople!
Bot: No.  We will not be intimidated by a dragon.  We will defend our people and our treasury.  We need to stand up to bullies, even fire-breathing ones.     

Game: RESPONSE: Dragon - Ooohoho, I'm gonna go eat some folks then! STATS: Population: 461(-30) Happiness: 206(0) Money: 813(0)
Bot: ok.  That's… bad.  We need to find a way to deal with this dragon. We can’t let him terrorize our kingdom.  This is a serious threat.  We need to take action.  Maybe hire a dragon slayer.  Or find a giant fire extinguisher.  Or maybe… *thinks hard*… offer him a giant sandwich?  Just a thought.  Desperation breeds creativity.          

Game: QUEST: Blacksmith - Sir, I heard about the dragon attack you were made to endure. I've come up with an idea to strike back. H I can craft a blade powerful enough to slay the dragon and take all his treasures. It won't be easy, though.. H I'll need to track down the finest metals, but they're quite costly. Might I have a few hundred gold to begin my search?
Bot: Yes. This is a worthwhile investment.  We need to deal with that dragon threat. A dragon-slaying blade sounds like just the ticket.  We need to protect our people.        

Game: RESPONSE: Blacksmith - Thank you, sir. I will keep you posted about further developments. I won't let you down! We'll strike back at that dragon yet! STATS: Population: 461(0) Happiness: 206(0) Money: 513(-300)
Bot: ok. Good. Glad to have the blacksmith on our side. He’s a valuable asset. We need to support his efforts.  A dragon-slaying blade is a good investment.  We need to protect our kingdom.          

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - I accidentally ate some folks out front, can I just pay you back with gold?
Bot: No. Absolutely not.  "Accidentally" eating people is not acceptable.  We will not tolerate this kind of behavior in our kingdom.  We need to find a way to deal with this chest creature. He’s a menace.         

Game: RESPONSE: Chester(mimic chest) - Wel|, I still ate them, sooo... STATS: Population: 456(-5) Happiness: 206(0) Money: 513(0)
Bot: ok.  This is unacceptable. We need to take action against this chest creature.  He can’t just go around eating people, "accidentally" or otherwise.  This is a serious problem. We need to find a solution, and fast.  Maybe… *thinks hard*…  A giant lock?  A very strong cage?  Or maybe… a giant indigestion tablet?  I don’t know. I’m just spitballing here.     

Game: EVENT - Day 18 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 491(+35) Happiness: 206(0) Money: 513(0)
Bot: ok.  Good growth, despite the dragon and chest creature incidents. Happiness is stable, but our finances took a hit. We need to be more careful.  We need to find a way to deal with these threats and protect our kingdom.  We need… a plan.  A good plan.  A Joe Biden plan.  *clears throat*…  A plan.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Since we opened our borders, trade from our caravans has increased dramatically. Do you wish to tax the merchants? H
Bot: Yes.  We need to generate revenue to support our kingdom's growth and defense.  Taxes are a necessary part of that.  But we need to be fair. We don’t want to stifle trade. We need to find a balance.         

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I will collect a fee from the traders. STATS: Population: 491(0) Happiness: 204(-2) Money: 613(+100)
Bot: ok. Good.  A much-needed boost to our treasury.  A slight dip in happiness, but it's a small price to pay for a stronger economy.  We need to invest wisely and protect our kingdom.        

Game: QUEST: Little Timmy - Mwaah! Can my fwends come ova to pwaaay?
Bot: Yes. Of course.  Let the children play. It's good for their development and happiness.  We need to encourage the next generation of leaders. Besides, who can say no to Little Timmy?         

Game: RESPONSE: Little Timmy - Dwwaahh!!! STATS: Population: 491(0) Happiness: 202(-2) Money: 613(0)
Bot: ok. Another small dip in happiness. I’m starting to see a pattern here. Maybe it’s just random fluctuations.  Or maybe there’s something more to it.  We need to keep an eye on this. We can't let happiness keep slipping.        

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Reporting in! I solved the mystery about who stole Mrs. Pumpkin's baking pan. Want me to turn him in? H
Bot: Yes.  We need to uphold the law. Stealing is wrong.  Justice must be served.  We need to maintain order in our kingdom.         

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Ohoho, it's off to the dungeon for him! STATS: Population: 490(-1) Happiness: 205(+3) Money: 613(0)
Bot: ok. Good. Glad to see justice served. And a slight boost to happiness. People feel safer when the laws are enforced. We need to maintain law and order in our kingdom. It's essential for a thriving society.          

Game: QUEST: Grandma - I read the nicest story in the paper today. Isn't it a lovely day?
Bot: Yes.  It is a lovely day.  Glad to see Grandma is enjoying the newspaper.  We should send her a subscription. Maybe a gift basket with some soup and a nice comfy blanket. Just a thought.           

Game: RESPONSE: Grandma - Very good, dearie! STATS: Population: 490(0) Happiness: 206(+1) Money: 613(0)
Bot: ok.  Good.  A happy Grandma is a happy kingdom.  We need to keep her supplied with newspapers and soup.  Maybe some ice cream too.  And a rocking chair.  And…  *trails off*  We’ll figure it out.    

Game: QUEST: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - I'm baaaack! I found these shiny yellow stones! Pretty cool, right?
Bot: Yes. Shiny yellow stones are cool.  Especially if they’re valuable. We should have them appraised. Maybe they’re gold. Or diamonds.  Or…  *gets excited*…  Magical happiness-inducing rocks!  That would solve our happiness problem!  A man can dream, can’t he?         

Game: RESPONSE: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - Soooo cool! STATS: Population: 490(0) Happiness: 211(+5) Money: 673(+60)
Bot: ok.  Shiny yellow stones *and* a boost to both happiness and our treasury!  Excellent!  Yet Yet is a valuable asset to our kingdom. We should send him on more adventures. Maybe give him a map and a compass.  And a sandwich.  Just not from that ungrateful mason.    

Game: EVENT - Day 19 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 525(+35) Happiness: 211(0) Money: 673(0)
Bot: ok.  Another day of excellent growth! Happiness is up, and our finances are healthy. We're making great strides.  We're building a truly exceptional kingdom.  Just like… *clears throat*… you know…  A great kingdom. That’s what I’m talking about. A great kingdom.  For the people. By the people.  And with plenty of shiny yellow stones.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - I've got news for you, sir. The city's population has reached 500! The townspeople are celebrating, there's to be a huge festival in the square! Our growing population will demand even more happiness now, be sure to keep our approval high. H Anyway, I just wanted to give my congratulations. Let's keep working hard, okay? H
Bot: Yes.  Let’s keep working hard. We're building something special here.  A kingdom for the ages.  A kingdom of happiness, prosperity, and…  *clears throat* … shiny yellow stones.  And maybe a Royal Circus. And definitely more cake.  Lots of cake.    

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I wonder just how big this city will grow under your rule, sir... STATS: Population: 525(0) Happiness: 211(0) Money: 823(0)
Bot: ok.  We’ll keep building, keep growing, keep striving for a better future.  For everyone.  That's the Joe Biden way. *clears throat* The… kingdom way.  That's it. The kingdom way.   

Game: QUEST: Pancake(black cat) - Mew. (It's that slightly magical cat from before. Does this mean we're friends now?)
Bot: Yes. We're friends. Cats are good.  Especially slightly magical ones.  They bring good luck and…  *pauses*…  sometimes a slight dip in happiness.  But we’ll work on that.       

Game: RESPONSE: Pancake(black cat) - Mrow! (I guess we are!) STATS: Population: 525(0) Happiness: 212(+1) Money: 823(0)
Bot: ok. Good.  A new feline friend.  We need all the friends we can get. Especially the slightly magical ones. They add a certain… je ne sais quoi… to the kingdom.  *smiles*     

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Villagers are complaining about garbage in the streets. Shall we hire workers to clean it up?
Bot: Yes. We need to keep our kingdom clean.  A clean kingdom is a happy kingdom.  And a healthy kingdom.  We can't let garbage pile up in the streets. That’s just… unsanitary.       

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - The villager's noses will thank you, surely. STATS: Population: 525(0) Happiness: 214(+2) Money: 773(-50)
Bot: ok. Good. A small price to pay for a cleaner, happier, and healthier kingdom.  We need to invest in public sanitation. It’s an important part of good governance.  Just like…  *clears throat*  Clean streets.  Happy people.  That's the idea.      

Game: QUEST: Drummer - Bum bum badum dum dum! Booooosh! Yeah!! You like my rhythm, bruh?
Bot: Yes.  Music is good.  It soothes the soul.  And it’s good for morale.  We need more music in our kingdom.  Maybe a Royal Orchestra.  Or a Royal Drum Circle.  *taps foot rhythmically*  We'll figure it out.       

Game: RESPONSE: Drummer - Yeeaaah! Badadadadabrap brap! I'm in the groove! STATS: Population: 525(0) Happiness: 217(+3) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok. Good.  Music makes people happy.  We need more of that.  Maybe we should hire this drummer for the Royal Drum Circle. Or the Royal Orchestra. Or both.  *hums a catchy tune*  We’ll see.      

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Mouton - Allo, sir! Are you looking for experienced barbers in your court?
Bot: Yes.  A good barber is a valuable asset to any kingdom.  We need to keep our citizens looking their best.  It's good for morale.  And hygiene.  A well-groomed kingdom is a happy kingdom.  *strokes chin thoughtfully*         

Game: RESPONSE: Monsieur Mouton - Then I shall join you! I am the best of the best! STATS: Population: 526(+1) Happiness: 217(0) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  Excellent. Glad to have a skilled barber join our ranks.  We need to keep our citizens looking sharp.  A well-coiffed kingdom is a confident kingdom.  And a confident kingdom is a… *clears throat*…  A good kingdom.  That's it.  A good kingdom.       

Game: EVENT: The festival in the town square celebrating the town's 500th citizen is still going strong, bringing happiness to all those who attend. STATS: Population: 526(0) Happiness: 222(+5) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  Excellent.  Festivals are good.  They bring people together.  And they boost morale.  We should have more festivals.  A Royal Festival of… something. We’ll figure it out.  Maybe a Festival of Shiny Yellow Stones.  Or a Festival of Cake.  Or both.  A Festival of Shiny Yellow Stones and Cake.  *nods approvingly*  It has a certain… ring to it.   

Game: EVENT - Day 20 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 549(+23) Happiness: 222(0) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  Another great day! Solid growth, happiness is up, and our finances are healthy.  We're doing a great job. We’re building a strong, prosperous, and well-coiffed kingdom. Just like… *clears throat*… you know… a great kingdom.  That's the one. A great kingdom. For the people. By the people.  With plenty of cake and shiny yellow stones. And a Royal Circus. And a Royal Drum Circle. And maybe a Royal Festival of Shiny Yellow Stones and Cake. *smiles broadly*  It's all coming together. 

Game: QUEST: Wizard - I was just passing through and thought you might like some magic. Anything could happen! Care to give it a try? H
Bot: No. We’re good for now, thanks. Magic has been a bit too unpredictable lately.  We need stability, not random magical events. We've learned our lesson.  Besides, things are going pretty well right now. No need to tempt fate.   

Game: RESPONSE: Wizard - I see, it's understandable that you don't want to take the risk. Farewell. STATS: Population: 549(0) Happiness: 222(0) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok. Good. We need to be careful. We can’t afford any more magical mishaps. We're on a roll, and we don't want to jinx it.    

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Do you find me humerus?
Bot: Yes.  (A skeleton pun?  Why not?  A little levity is always good.  Besides, he's been helpful with the snooping.)      

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Har har, yeah, it's a good one, right? STATS: Population: 549(0) Happiness: 224(+2) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  Good. A little humor boosts morale.  We need more of that. Maybe we should hire a comedian for the Royal Court. Or a troupe of performing skeletons.  *chuckles*  The possibilities are endless.       

Game: QUEST: Stumpy(living stump of tree) - Hello, King. I am a tree, of the western forest. As you can see, however, I have been, shall we say... shortened. H This is due largely in fact to the actions of your team of woodcutters. My home has been chopped clean through! H In your reckless pursuit of expansion, you have now distrupted the lives of myself and my good treefolk brothers and sisters. I demand compensation by way of golden coin, so that we might repair this... how shall I put it? Diplomatic rift between us... A paltry sum of ohh, say... one thousand coins would go a long ways towards relaxing our troubled relationship.
Bot: No. We appreciate the concerns of the treefolk, but one thousand coins is excessive. We need to find a more reasonable solution. Perhaps we can offer them some… fertilizer? Or maybe some new saplings?  Or…  *thinks hard*…  A Royal Arborist?  Someone to help them rebuild their forest. We need to find a compromise. We can’t afford to alienate the treefolk. They’re an important part of our ecosystem.        

Game: RESPONSE: Stumpy(living stump of tree) - This is a development which will surely be met with distaste in the community of treefolk. H Your refusal to cooperate, compounded with your woodcutter's aggression, has driven me to the peak of anger! H Rest assurred, King. I will not be silent! This destruction you have wrought on my kin will be known to all! H STATS: Population: 549(0) Happiness: 221(-3) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  This is not good. We need to find a way to appease the treefolk.  We can’t afford a “diplomatic rift” with them.  We need to find a compromise, and fast. This situation could escalate quickly. We need to be proactive.  Maybe…  *thinks hard* … A Royal Treefolk Embassy?  With a resident ambassador?  And maybe a…  *gets excited*… Royal Treefolk Festival of…  Shiny Yellow Stones and… Saplings?  It has a certain… *trails off*…  We’ll figure it out.       

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Since we opened our borders, trade from our caravans has increased dramatically. Do you wish to tax the merchants? H
Bot: No. We need to be careful not to overtax our merchants. We need to encourage trade, not stifle it.  We need to find other ways to generate revenue. We can’t afford to alienate our trading partners.  Especially with the treefolk situation brewing. We need to prioritize stability and diplomacy right now.          

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - They'll appreciate that, but you're passing up easy money, sire! STATS: Population: 549(0) Happiness: 227(+6) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  A nice boost to happiness.  That’s good.  We need to keep our citizens happy, especially our merchants. They’re the engine of our economy.  We’ll find other ways to generate revenue.  We need to be creative.  And diplomatic.  Just like… *clears throat*…  A good king.  That’s the key. A good king.     

Game: EVENT: Scientist - Hello, hello! I am, well, I am the Scientist! I do science, for you, King! You see, the city has grown, and we have grown, too. The science community, that is! We now have our very own Council of Science, of which I am the leader. Today, I simply wish to introduce myself. And now I have, I have. I will visit you again in the future, regarding our projects. Science projects! STATS: Population: 549(0) Happiness: 227(0) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  A Council of Science? That sounds… impressive.  Science is good.  We need science to progress.  To innovate.  To… *gets excited*… build a better future!  Just like… *clears throat*… you know…  Science.  Progress.  The future.  That’s what it’s all about. I look forward to hearing about their science projects.  Hopefully, they can help us solve our happiness and treefolk problems. And maybe invent a dragon-repellent.  Or a chest-creature-deterrent.  The possibilities are endless!    

Game: EVENT: The festival in the town square is winding down and people are getting back to their normal lives. STATS: Population: 549(0) Happiness: 229(+2) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok.  Good. A little post-festival happiness boost.  We need to keep the good times rolling.  Maybe we should start planning the next festival.  The Royal Treefolk Festival of Shiny Yellow Stones and Saplings is still on the table.  *nods thoughtfully* We’ll need a lot of saplings.  And shiny yellow stones.  And cake.  Definitely cake.      

Game: EVENT - Day 21 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 572(+23) Happiness: 229(0) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok. Another day of solid growth! Happiness is up, and our finances are stable. We’re making great progress. We’re building a strong, prosperous, scientific, and well-coiffed kingdom. Just like… *clears throat*… you know… a great kingdom. That’s the ticket.  A great kingdom. For the people. By the people. With plenty of cake, shiny yellow stones, scientific breakthroughs, expertly-barbered citizens, and hopefully, a resolution to the treefolk situation. And a Royal Circus. And a Royal Drum Circle. And maybe even a Royal Treefolk Festival of Shiny Yellow Stones and Saplings. *smiles broadly* It’s a lot to juggle, but we’ll manage.  We’re good at juggling. We have a jester, after all. 

Game: QUEST: Pancake(black cat) - Mew. (It's that slightly magical cat from before. Does this mean we're friends now?)
Bot: Yes. We're friends. Old friends, in fact. Cats are good. Slightly magical cats are even better. Usually.  Sometimes they cause a slight dip in happiness, but we're working on that. We're all about positive relationships in this kingdom. Even with slightly magical cats.    

Game: RESPONSE: Pancake(black cat) - Mrow! (I guess we are!) STATS: Population: 572(0) Happiness: 230(+1) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok. Good. Another feline friend.  We appreciate all our friends, furry and otherwise. They enrich our kingdom in their own special ways. Even if it's just a small boost to happiness. Every little bit helps.      

Game: QUEST: Drummer - Boom boom, badoom doom doom! I'm really getting into it, are you!?
Bot: Yes.  Music is good.  It's good for the soul. And for the kingdom. We need more music.  Maybe a Royal Orchestra. Or a Royal Drum Circle.  Or a Royal Cat Choir.  *starts humming a catchy tune*  The possibilities are endless!     

Game: RESPONSE: Drummer - That's what I thought! BadabadabadaBOOSH! So into it! STATS: Population: 572(0) Happiness: 235(+5) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok. Excellent! Music is a powerful force for good. We need to harness its power to boost morale and build a more harmonious kingdom. *taps foot rhythmically* We’re on a roll!     

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - I'm the Duke of Spook! Do you want a spooky nickname?
Bot: No.  Still no.  "Joe" is fine.  And please, stop calling yourself the Duke of Spook.  It's bad for our happiness levels.  You’re like a walking, or rather, flying, happiness black hole. We need to keep our distance.     

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Aw, man... You're no fun. STATS: Population: 572(0) Happiness: 234(-1) Money: 773(0)
Bot: ok. Knew it.  A small dip, but predictable. We need to find a way to deal with this Duke of Spook.  Maybe a "No Dukes of Spook Allowed" sign. Or a… *thinks hard*…  A happiness-inducing force field?  Something to neutralize his negative energy.  We'll figure it out.  Science can help.  I have faith in the Council of Science.         

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Builders wish to construct more houses in the town. They request gold, with which they could build much faster! H
Bot: Yes. More housing is essential for a growing kingdom.  We need to support our builders.  It's a good investment in our future.  Besides, we can afford it.  Let's build!      

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I shall bring this to them right away. Our city grows! STATS: Population: 579(+7) Happiness: 234(0) Money: 673(-100)
Bot: ok. Good.  More houses, more citizens, more prosperity. It’s a virtuous cycle. We need to keep it going.  A small dip in our finances, but it’s a worthwhile investment. We’re building for the future.  Just like… *clears throat*… you know… Building.  The future.  That's what it’s all about.       

Game: QUEST: Blacksmith - Would you like to purchase any swords for your guards? A well protected city is a happy city!
Bot: Yes. We need to keep our kingdom safe.  A well-armed guard is essential for that. We need to invest in our defenses.  Especially with that dragon still lurking around. And that chest creature with a penchant for "accidentally" eating people.  We need to be prepared.      

Game: RESPONSE: Blacksmith - Great, I'll have a shipment of swords sent to your barracks. STATS: Population: 579(0) Happiness: 244(+10) Money: 653(-20)
Bot: ok.  Good. A small price to pay for increased security and a significant boost to happiness.  A well-defended kingdom is a happy kingdom.  And a safe kingdom.  We need both.  Safety and happiness.  Just like… *clears throat*… you know…  Safety and happiness.  That’s the ticket.          

Game: EVENT - Day 22 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 614(+35) Happiness: 244(0) Money: 653(0)
Bot: ok. Excellent growth! Happiness is way up, and our finances are healthy. We're doing fantastic. We're building a strong, prosperous, scientific, well-coiffed, well-defended, and musically-inclined kingdom. Just like… *clears throat*… you know… a great kingdom.  That’s what we’re aiming for.  A great kingdom. For the people. By the people.  With cake. And shiny yellow stones. And a Royal Circus. And a Royal Drum Circle.  And maybe a Royal Orchestra. And a Royal Cat Choir.  *smiles, then pauses*  We might need a bigger castle. 

Game: EVENT: Yarno - Allo! Allo! I am Yarno, of the Comfy Kingdom! You may not believe this, but I am the royal assistant of King Pin himself. Indeed, the very same! H I've been noodling around this kingdom of yours and I - oh, wait! What's that over there! H STATS: Population: 614(0) Happiness: 244(0) Money: 653(0)
Bot: ok.  King Pin's royal assistant?  Interesting. I wonder what he wants.  And what he saw. Hopefully, it's not another dragon. Or chest creature. Or Duke of Spook.  We've had enough excitement for a while. We need a period of…  *clears throat* … peaceful prosperity.  That’s the ticket. Peaceful prosperity.    

Game: QUEST: Button Boy - Good sir, did you happen to see a blue fellow come through here just now? Strange noodly limbs? Made of yarn?
Bot: Yes. I believe I did. A rather… unusual fellow.  Noodly limbs, you say? Made of yarn? That's certainly… distinctive.  I hope he wasn’t causing any trouble.         

Game: QUEST: Button Boy - I knew he was around here somewhere! I'm going to find that darned Yarno! He's been running around claiming to be King Pin's royal assistant, which of course, he is NOT. H In fact it is I, Button Boy, who represents the Comfy Kingdom in the esteemed Council of Crowns. Have you heard of the Council of Crowns, good sir?
Bot: Yes.  I have heard of the Council of Crowns.  It seems everyone is talking about them these days.  A council of crowns… sounds… regal.  And powerful.  We should definitely try to make a good impression.  Just in case they’re looking for new members. *clears throat*  You know… just in case.          

Game: QUEST: Button Boy - Then surely you've thought about joining! Perhaps we could work out a bit of a deal.. That Yarno's been giving me nothing but trouble. If you could somehow put a stop to his shenanigans... I might be able to get you a meeting with Pia, the advisor of the Celestial Kingdom. If anyone would be able to induct your kingdom into the Council, it would be her. What do you say? Will you help me catch that darned yarn?
Bot: Yes. We’re always happy to help a fellow ruler, especially one who represents a kingdom in the esteemed Council of Crowns. And a meeting with Pia, advisor of the Celestial Kingdom? That’s an opportunity we can’t pass up.  We need to make a good impression.  This could be our ticket to the Council of Crowns.  *gets excited*  Just like… *clears throat*  The Council of Crowns.  That’s the goal.      

Game: RESPONSE: Button Boy - Very good. I'll leave the details up to your discretion. Once Yarno is out of the way, I'll set up a meeting with Pia. H Thank you for your assistance in this matter, good sir. I'm sure we will meet again soon. H STATS: Population: 614(0) Happiness: 244(0) Money: 653(0)
Bot: ok. Excellent.  We need to find this Yarno and…  *pauses* …  What exactly are we supposed to do with him?  We’ll figure it out. We’re good at figuring things out.  We’re… resourceful.  And diplomatic.  And… *clears throat* … We’re…  We’re good.  Just good.  That’s it.  Good.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - My lord, our city has grown so much that visitors are becoming lost quite easily. Shall we devote more gold to the hiring of tour guides?
Bot: Yes.  We need to make our kingdom welcoming to visitors.  Tour guides are a good investment. They can help our visitors navigate our growing city and discover all it has to offer.  It’s good for tourism. And for our economy. And for our reputation.  We want to be known as a hospitable kingdom.  A welcoming kingdom.  A kingdom with… *clears throat*…  Good tour guides.  That's the key. Good tour guides.          

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - The tourists will thank you, I'm sure! STATS: Population: 614(0) Happiness: 247(+3) Money: 583(-70)
Bot: ok.  A small price to pay for happy tourists. Happy tourists spend money.  And spending money is good for our economy.  It’s a win-win.  Just like… *clears throat*… you know…  Happy tourists.  Strong economy.  That's the idea.         

Game: QUEST: Grandma - Eeeh, hello sonny. Can I borrow a coin for the newspaper?
Bot: Yes. Of course, Grandma.  Here you go.  An informed citizenry is a happy citizenry.  And a happy Grandma is a happy kingdom. We need to keep her supplied with newspapers.  And soup. And maybe some ice cream.  And a rocking chair.  And… *trails off*  We’ll figure it out.            

Game: RESPONSE: Grandma - Thank you dearie. STATS: Population: 614(0) Happiness: 248(+1) Money: 582(-1)
Bot: ok. Good. A small price to pay for a happy Grandma. And an informed citizenry.  We need to invest in our senior citizens.  They’re the…  *pauses*…  The wisdom keepers of our kingdom.  That’s it.  The wisdom keepers.      

Game: QUEST: Yettu(yetti creature) - Hello good sir I have returned. Will you give me some money this time?
Bot: No.  Still no. We don't just give handouts.  We believe in hard work and earning your keep. We have plenty of jobs available.  Maybe he can be a tour guide.  Or a…  *thinks hard*…  A yeti-shaped topiary in the Royal Gardens?  We’ll figure something out.             

Game: RESPONSE: Yettu(yetti creature) - Fine then. I shall return another day. STATS: Population: 614(0) Happiness: 247(-1) Money: 582(0)
Bot: ok.  Another small dip in happiness.  This yetti is becoming a real problem. We need to find a way to discourage him from coming back. Maybe a "No Yettis Allowed" sign. Or a… *gets a mischievous glint in his eye*… a giant catapult to launch him back to wherever he came from. Just a thought.  We'll consider all our options.        

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - You feelin' spooky today?
Bot: No. Definitely not. We're feeling… prosperous. And well-coiffed. And well-defended.  And slightly sleepy.  But definitely not spooky.  We need to avoid spookiness. It’s bad for our happiness levels.  Especially when it comes in the form of a self-proclaimed Duke of Spook.          

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Not even a tiny spook? Little baby bat? STATS: Population: 614(0) Happiness: 247(0) Money: 582(0)
Bot: ok. No spookiness.  None whatsoever. We're all about positivity and good vibes in this kingdom.  Spooky vibes are strictly prohibited. Unless they come in the form of… *pauses*…  A Spooky-But-Not-Too-Spooky Royal Halloween Party?  With costumes and candy and…  *gets excited*…  A pumpkin-carving contest judged by the All-Seeing Eye!  *nods approvingly*  That could work. We’ll put it on the list.      

Game: EVENT: Guards say somebody was eaten by an enchanted treasure chest of some variety in the middle of the night. STATS: Population: 613(-1) Happiness: 247(0) Money: 582(0)
Bot: ok.  That chest creature again. We need to deal with this menace. We can't have people being eaten, "accidentally" or otherwise.  This is a serious problem.  We need a solution, and fast.  Maybe…  *thinks hard*… A giant mousetrap?  But for chests. A giant chest trap.  Or… *gets a mischievous glint in his eye*… we could feed him to the dragon.  Two birds, one stone.  We’ll consider all our options.      

Game: EVENT: Louis was giving out free cake in the market today, much to the citizen's delight. STATS: Population: 613(0) Happiness: 248(+1) Money: 582(0)
Bot: ok.  Good.  Free cake is always a good idea. It boosts morale and makes people happy.  We need more free cake.  Maybe a Royal Cake Day?  Where everyone gets free cake.  And ice cream. And maybe a shiny yellow stone.  *smiles broadly*  It’s a party!     

Game: EVENT: Papers have been posted around town spreading news of the destruction of the western forest. The people feel quite guilty about this. STATS: Population: 613(0) Happiness: 243(-5) Money: 582(0)
Bot: ok.  The treefolk situation is getting worse.  We need to address this, and quickly.  We can’t afford to have our citizens feeling guilty.  Guilt is bad for morale.  And for our reputation.  We need to find a solution that works for everyone.  A compromise.  A…  *thinks hard* …  A Royal Treefolk Apology Tour?  With free saplings for everyone?  And maybe a…  *gets excited*…  A tree-planting ceremony officiated by the All-Seeing Eye?  *nods approvingly*  It has potential. We’ll add it to the list.          

Game: EVENT - Day 23 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 647(+34) Happiness: 243(0) Money: 582(0)
Bot: ok. Good growth, but happiness took a hit. We need to address the treefolk situation and find a way to boost morale.  We're doing well overall, but we can’t afford to ignore this growing discontent.  We need to be proactive.  And diplomatic.  And…  *clears throat*…  A good king.  That's what we need to be.  A good king.  For the people. By the people.  With cake.  And shiny yellow stones. And hopefully, a peaceful resolution with the treefolk.  And a Royal Circus. And a Royal Drum Circle. And maybe a Royal Orchestra. And a Royal Cat Choir.  And a Spooky-But-Not-Too-Spooky Royal Halloween Party. And a Royal Cake Day.  And a Royal Treefolk Apology Tour. *takes a deep breath*  It’s a lot. But we’ll handle it.  We’re good at handling things.  We’re…  *smiles wearily* …  We’re Joe.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Our granary stock has been infected. It'll cost us to replace it, but if we don't people could get sick. Should we do it? H
Bot: Yes. We need to protect our people's health. Replacing the infected grain is a necessary expense. We can't risk an outbreak of illness. It's the responsible thing to do.  A healthy kingdom is a happy kingdom.  And a productive kingdom.  We need all three. Health, happiness, and productivity.  Just like… *clears throat*…  You know… the three H’s.  That’s it. The three H’s.      

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Yes, our people's health is worth the cost. STATS: Population: 647(0) Happiness: 244(+1) Money: 512(-70)
Bot: ok. A small price to pay for the health of our citizens. We need to prioritize public health. It's essential for a thriving kingdom.  Just like…  *clears throat*…  Public health. Thriving kingdom.  That's the connection. We need to make that connection clear to everyone.  Maybe a public service announcement?  Or a… *gets excited* … A Royal Health and Wellness Fair?  With free checkups and…  *pauses*…  Free apples?  Oranges?  Something healthy.  We’ll figure it out.  We're good at figuring things out.    

Game: QUEST: Stumpy(living stump of tree) - I have returned, and not without cause! Prepare yourself for a protest of unimaginable proportions! H I am rooted! I will not budge from this spot until you answer for your crimes against my people. Your workers have wounded our way of life. Things will never be the same in the forest. H What say you? Will you first at least admit to your countrymen's wrongdoing?
Bot: Yes. We admit our woodcutters were overzealous in their pursuit of lumber. We apologize for the damage done to the western forest and the disruption to the lives of the treefolk.  We value our relationship with the treefolk and want to find a way to make amends. We're willing to… *clears throat* … work together. To rebuild. To heal.  That’s what we need to do. Work together.  Rebuild.  Heal.  Just like…  *pauses*…  A good neighbor.  That's what we need to be. A good neighbor.       

Game: RESPONSE: Stumpy(living stump of tree) - You... you will? As you should! Wrongdoings indeed... To be perfectly transparent, I must admit I did not expect you to say that. I'm not really sure where to go from here. Perhaps I will... leave... I mean... leaf.. STATS: Population: 647(0) Happiness: 246(+2) Money: 512(0)
Bot: ok.  Good.  An apology goes a long way.  We’re glad the treefolk are willing to… leaf…  *chuckles*…  We need to build on this positive momentum.  We need to follow through on our apology with concrete action.  We need to… *thinks hard* …  Plant some trees!  Lots of trees!  A Royal Tree-Planting Initiative!  With free saplings for everyone!  And maybe… *gets excited* …  A Royal Treefolk Festival of Shiny Yellow Stones and Saplings?  It’s still on the table.  *nods enthusiastically*  We’ll make this right.  We’re good at making things right. We’re…  *clears throat*…  We’re Joe.   

Game: QUEST: Sneaky Girl - Want me to steal from the rich and give to... you? Not just the rich, I'll steal from whoever, basically. H
Bot: No. Stealing is wrong. We don’t need to resort to illegal activities. We’re doing just fine without resorting to theft. We believe in honesty and integrity. It's the…  *pauses*…  The right thing to do.  That's it. The right thing.       

Game: RESPONSE: Sneaky Girl - Taking the high road, huh? I'll see you around. STATS: Population: 647(0) Happiness: 246(0) Money: 512(0)
Bot: ok.  Good riddance. We don't need her kind in our kingdom. We’re building a kingdom of honesty and integrity. Not a kingdom of… *clears throat* … sneakiness and thievery. That’s not the kind of kingdom we want.  We want a good kingdom.  A kingdom where people can trust each other.  A kingdom where…  *trails off*…  Where everyone gets along.  That’s the dream.         

Game: QUEST: L-D 3.4(robot) - H- H- Hello! I. Am. Serial number L. D. Three. Point. Four. C- C- C- Can you f- f- fix me? H
Bot: Yes. We can try.  We have a Council of Science now. They’re good at fixing things.  Or at least, they will be. They're still new at this whole science thing.  But they’re learning fast.  We have faith in them. We believe in…  *clears throat* … science and progress. That’s the key. Science and progress.  Just like… *pauses*…  You know…  The future.         

Game: RESPONSE: L-D 3.4(robot) - T- T- T- Thanks. Friend. I. Am. Become. Fixed. STATS: Population: 647(0) Happiness: 251(+5) Money: 412(-100)
Bot: ok.  Good.  Glad to see the Council of Science is proving their worth.  A small hit to our finances, but it was worth it.  A fixed robot is a happy robot. And a happy robot is a… *pauses*…  A productive member of society?  I don’t know. We’ll figure it out. We’re good at figuring things out. We’re…  *clears throat*…  Resourceful. That’s the word. Resourceful.         

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - The prison is in need of repairs. Might there be room in the budget to devote a few hundred gold to it? H
Bot: Yes. We need a strong prison to maintain law and order.  It's a necessary expense.  A secure prison keeps criminals off the streets and protects our citizens.  It’s a good investment in public safety.  Just like… *clears throat*…  You know… Public safety. Good investment. That’s the connection. We need to make that connection clear to everyone.  Maybe a public service announcement?  Or a…  *gets excited* … A Royal Prison Open House?  With tours and… *pauses*…  Refreshments?  I don’t know. We’ll figure it out.         

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Very good, it is best to not allow the prison to crumble, I'm sure you agree. STATS: Population: 647(0) Happiness: 251(0) Money: 162(-250)
Bot: ok. Another hit to our finances, but a necessary one. We need to keep our kingdom safe.  A secure prison is essential for that.  Just like…  *clears throat*  A safe kingdom.  A secure prison.  That’s the link.  We need to emphasize that link.  Maybe a… *gets a mischievous glint in his eye*… “Lock ‘Em Up” campaign?  With catchy slogans and… *pauses*…  Free miniature padlocks?  We’ll workshop it.      

Game: EVENT: Workers at a construction site arrived in the morning to find all of their lumber stolen, setting work back by weeks. STATS: Population: 647(0) Happiness: 248(-3) Money: 112(-50)
Bot: ok.  This is bad.  We need to find whoever is responsible for this theft.  Stealing lumber is… unacceptable.  It sets back our construction projects, hurts our economy, and lowers morale. We need to take action.  We need to…  *thinks hard* … Increase security at construction sites!  Hire more guards!  Install… *gets excited* …  Lumber alarms!  That’s it!  Lumber alarms!  Like burglar alarms, but for lumber.  We’re brilliant!  We’ll take it to the Council of Science.  They can make it happen.  Science can solve anything!     

Game: EVENT - Day 24 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 681(+34) Happiness: 248(0) Money: 112(0)
Bot: ok. Good growth, but happiness is down and our finances are hurting. We need to address the lumber theft and the treefolk situation. And find a way to generate more revenue.  We have a lot on our plate, but we’ll handle it.  We’re good at handling things. We’re… *clears throat*… resilient. That's the word. Resilient.  Just like… *pauses*…  You know…  A good kingdom.  A resilient kingdom. That’s what we’re building. A resilient kingdom.  For the people. By the people. With… *trails off*…  Hopefully, enough money to pay for all these Royal initiatives.  We need to have a serious talk with the Royal Treasurer.   

Game: QUEST: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - Name's Molder. If you want to know the truth about... everything... you're gonna want to hire me.
Bot: Yes. We’re always interested in the truth. Especially about… everything.  Knowledge is power.  And we need all the power we can get.  Especially with all these challenges facing our kingdom.  The treefolk, the dragon, the chest creature, the Duke of Spook, the stolen lumber… it’s a lot. We need answers.  And Molder, the purple blob of sludge, might just have them.  We’ll take a chance. We’re… *clears throat*…  Open-minded.  That’s it. Open-minded.   

Game: RESPONSE: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - I'm gonna go... investigate something. STATS: Population: 681(0) Happiness: 248(0) Money: 102(-10)
Bot: ok.  Good.  Let’s hope he uncovers something useful.  We need answers. And solutions.  And… *pauses*…  Money.  We definitely need more money.  We’re running low.  We need to find a way to boost our treasury.  Maybe we should…  *gets a mischievous glint in his eye* …  Start a Royal Casino?  With blackjack and poker and… *pauses* …  A slot machine featuring the All-Seeing Eye?  It could work.  We’ll add it to the list.       

Game: QUEST: Scientist - Hello, hello! The Council of Science has devised a blueprint for a gold-generating machine! H It will take some time to construct, yes, yes, and many resources.. But, if my calculations are correct, at least, it will produce gold steadily for the rest of eternity! H Perhaps you might initiate this project with a small research grant of five hundred gold?
Bot: No.  Five hundred gold is a lot of money.  Especially right now.  We're running low on funds. We need to be more careful with our spending.  A gold-generating machine sounds… fantastic.  But we can’t afford it right now. We need to find a more… *clears throat* … fiscally responsible solution to our financial woes. That’s the key.  Fiscal responsibility.  Just like… *pauses* … A good king. A fiscally responsible king. That's what we need to be.  A fiscally responsible king.         

Game: QUEST: All—Seeing Eye - (It's just.. staring at me... Does it want something?)
Bot: Yes.  Let’s see what it wants.  Maybe it’s offering us another influx of gold.  We could certainly use it. Or maybe it’s trying to tell us something important.  We need to be receptive.  To… *clears throat*…  The wisdom of the All-Seeing Eye. That's what we need.  The wisdom of the All-Seeing Eye.       

Game: RESPONSE: All—Seeing Eye - (What just happened? I feel... unlucky!) STATS: Population: 681(0) Happiness: 248(0) Money: 2(-100)
Bot: ok.  Well, that’s… not good. We’re down to two gold coins.  Two!  That’s… alarming.  We need to find a way to generate revenue, and fast.  We’re in serious financial trouble. We need to… *thinks hard* …  Declare a Royal Emergency Fundraiser!  With bake sales and car washes and… *pauses*…  A kissing booth featuring the All-Seeing Eye?  I don't know.  We're desperate.  We’ll consider all options.    

Game: QUEST: Jester - My shooooooow seems to have goooone over well! I wish to expand my proooooduction! H Funds, I shall need! Foooour hundred goooooold or soooooooo!
Bot: No.  We can’t afford it.  We have two gold coins.  Two! We can barely afford a sandwich, let alone a… *clears throat*…  An expanded jester production. That’s just not feasible right now. We need to focus on generating revenue, not spending it. We need to be…  *pauses*… fiscally responsible. That's the key. Fiscal responsibility.  Just like… *trails off*…  A king on a budget.  That’s what we are.  A king on a budget.        

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Oooohhhh noooooooo... STATS: Population: 681(0) Happiness: 245(-3) Money: 2(0)
Bot: ok.  Happiness is down.  Our finances are in shambles.  We need a miracle.  Or… *gets a determined glint in his eye* …  A really good plan.  A Joe Biden plan. *clears throat*… A kingdom plan. That’s it.  A kingdom plan.  We need to rally our advisors, consult with the Council of Science, and… *pauses*…  Maybe sell some of those shiny yellow stones?  We’ll consider all options.  We’re in crisis mode.      

Game: QUEST: Witch - The spirits are appeased right now, but perhaps we should grant them an offering of gold. H I know the spirit world always appreciates gold, and it might prevent them from haunting us in the future. What do you say? Two hundred gold would make a decent offering.
Bot: No.  Absolutely not.  We have two gold coins. Two! We can’t afford to appease any spirits, no matter how… *clears throat* … persuasive they may be. We need every coin we can get. We’re in survival mode. We need to prioritize… *pauses* …  Fiscal solvency. That's what we need. Fiscal solvency.  Just like… *trails off*… A king on the brink of bankruptcy.  That's what we are. A king on the brink of bankruptcy.     

Game: RESPONSE: Witch - Nothing for now, then. I'll let you know if anything changes with the spirit world. STATS: Population: 681(0) Happiness: 245(0) Money: 2(0)
Bot: ok.  Good.  No hauntings for now.  That’s something, at least. We need to focus on getting our finances in order.  We need a plan.  A bold plan.  A… *clears throat*…  A financially sound plan.  That's the key. A financially sound plan. We need to…  *thinks hard*…  Sell those shiny yellow stones!  And maybe…  *gets a mischievous glint in his eye*…  Pawn the Royal Scepter?  Or the Royal Crown?  We’ll consider all options.  We’re desperate.

A game-changing idea.  A…  *clears throat*…  A Joe Biden idea.  *pauses, then corrects himself* … A kingdom-saving idea.  That’s it. A kingdom-saving idea. We need to…  *thinks hard*…  Organize a Royal Bake Sale!  With cookies and cakes and…  *gets excited*…  All-Seeing Eye-shaped pies!  And maybe a…  *pauses* …  A Royal Car Wash?  With the Royal Guard washing carriages?  And…  *gets a mischievous glint in his eye*…  Me drying them with the Royal Towels?  *smiles broadly*  It could work. We’ll add it to the list. We’re not giving up.  We’re resilient. We’re… *clears throat* … Joe.  We’re Joe. 

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - I accidentally ate some folks out front, can I just pay you back with gold?
Bot: No.  Absolutely not.  "Accidentally" eating our citizens is unacceptable.  We will not tolerate this behavior.  We need to find a way to… *clears throat* … contain this chest creature.  Permanently.  That’s what we need to do. Contain him. Permanently.  Maybe…  *thinks hard* …  A giant, inescapable dungeon?  Or a…  *gets excited* … A rocket to launch him into space?  We’ll take it to the Council of Science.  They’ll figure it out.  Science can solve anything!  Except our current financial crisis.  We still need to sell those shiny yellow stones. And maybe pawn the Royal Scepter.  Or the Royal Crown.  *sighs*  We’re desperate. 

Game: RESPONSE: Chester(mimic chest) - Wel|, I still ate them, sooo... STATS: Population: 711(-5) Happiness: 245(0) Money: 2(0)

We’re Joe. 

Game: QUEST: Knight - I saw a beautiful silver gauntlet in the blacksmith's today. May I have funds to purchase it? H
Bot: No.  Absolutely not.  We have two gold coins.  Two!  We can’t afford a silver gauntlet, no matter how… *clears throat* … beautiful it may be.  We need to focus on essential expenses.  Like… *pauses* …  Food.  Shelter.  Defense.  Not…  Gauntlets.  We need to be…  *sighs* …  Fiscally responsible.  That’s the word.  Fiscally responsible. Just like… *trails off*…  A king in dire financial straits.  That’s what we are. A king in dire financial straits. 

Game: RESPONSE: Knight - I see... I have not yet earned the honour... STATS: Population: 711(0) Happiness: 244(-1) Money: 2(0)

Game: QUEST: Drummer - Want me to do a drumroll?
Bot: Yes.  A drumroll sounds good. It might boost morale.  And we desperately need a morale boost.  Besides, it’s free entertainment. We can’t afford to pay for entertainment right now. We have two gold coins.  Two!  We’re practically bankrupt. But a drumroll?  A drumroll we can afford.

Bot: Ok.  A nice boost to happiness.  We need more drumrolls.  Maybe a Royal Drumroll Hour? Every day?  *taps foot rhythmically*  We'll put it on the list.  Right after we sell those shiny yellow stones and pawn the Royal Scepter and Crown. We’re desperate.  But we’re not giving up. We’re… *clears throat*… Joe. We’re Joe.   

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Hello friend. Care to gaze into my magical vampire crystal?
Bot: No.  We’re good, thanks. We’ve had enough magical experiences lately.  They haven't been particularly… *clears throat* … beneficial.  We need practical solutions to our problems.

Game: QUEST: Witch - My broom's all worn out, and it's my birthday.. Think you could buy me a new broom for a present? Sure would be nice of you!
Bot: No.  We’re sorry, but we can’t afford it.  We have two gold coins.  Two!  We can barely afford to… *clears throat* … breathe. Let alone buy a new broom.  Even for a witch’s birthday.  We need to focus on… *pauses* …  Essential expenditures.  That’s the key. Essential expenditures.  Like… *thinks hard* …  Food.  Shelter.  Defense.  Not brooms.  We need to be… *sighs*…  Fiscally responsible. That’s it. Fiscally responsible.  Just like… *trails off*… A king living on a shoestring budget.  That’s what we are.

Maybe…  *gets a hopeful look in his eye* …  The All-Seeing Eye will take pity on us and shower us with gold?  Or maybe… *gets a mischievous glint in his eye* … We could organize a Royal Raffle?  With prizes like…  *pauses* …  A dinner with the King?  A tour of the Royal Gardens?  A chance to polish the Royal Scepter?  *smiles broadly* It could work.  We’ll add it to the list.

We’re still operating on a… *pauses*… shoestring budget.  That’s the phrase.  A shoestring budget.  We need every gold coin we can get.  We can’t afford to… *gets a mischievous glint in his eye* …  Bribe the spirits.  Even if it means risking a haunting. We’re…  *smiles bravely* …  Risk-takers.  That’s what we are.  Risk-takers.
