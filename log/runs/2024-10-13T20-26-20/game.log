Bot: yes.  Somebody's gotta make the tough calls.  Better me than some… *advisor*. 

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Good! You've already got the hang of it. Our city's still very small right now, but it certainly has the potential to grow. Perhaps one day we will have a bustling metropolis and you'll be invited to join the Council of Crowns! H For now all you need to concern yourself with is keeping the citizens happy and growing our population. H Do your best, sir! STATS: Population: 100(0) Happiness: 100(0) Money: 200(0)

Game: QUEST: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - Name's Molder. If you want to know the truth about... everything... you're gonna want to hire me.

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Good day sir. Do you require any haunting services? For a small price I'll scare some people for you. H

Bot: ok.  Not bad for a day's work.  Still got that swamp smell though… need a good mud bath. 

Game: QUEST: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - I... couldn't uncover anything. I was being followed. Too risky. Did you see anyone follow me out of the castle? H
Bot: no.  I haven't seen anybody, but I wouldn't be surprised if someone wants my smelly treasures.   

Game: RESPONSE: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - I suspected as much. Very suspicious.. STATS: Population: 107(0) Happiness: 108(0) Money: 140(0)
Bot: ok. Suspicious is right. Better keep an eye out. My onion carriage can’t fall into the wrong hands. Or hooves…  Or paws… Whatever. 

Game: QUEST: Gardener - Plants are interesting, don't you think? I would like to open a garden, may I have some workers to help me? H
Bot: yes.  A garden sounds…tolerable.  Better than onions, I guess.  Less smelly too, hopefully. 

Game: RESPONSE: Gardener - Thank you, I will send them back as soon as they're done. STATS: Population: 104(-3) Happiness: 108(0) Money: 140(0)
Bot: ok.  Hope those workers come back…  Fiona would like a garden, come to think of it.  If it has less bees…    

Game: QUEST: Military General - A nearby town has asked us to form an alliance with them. Should we use them to beef up our ranks? H

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Together our towns will grow stronger! STATS: Population: 149(+30) Happiness: 118(+10) Money: 190(+50)

Bot: ok. Exploring, huh? Hope he finds something good. Like a really big onion. Or a self-cleaning outhouse.   

Game: QUEST: Yettu(yetti creature) - I would like some money please.
Bot: no.  Money doesn't grow on trees, ya know.  Even if you ARE hairy enough to live in one.   

Game: RESPONSE: Yettu(yetti creature) - Fine then. I shall return another day. STATS: Population: 160(0) Happiness: 124(-1) Money: 90(0)

Game: RESPONSE: Wizard - Aaah, my apologies. I guess the spell turned out to be evil. STATS: Population: 151(-10) Happiness: 109(-15) Money: 90(0)
Bot: ok. EVIL?! What kind of wizard does EVIL spells?!  I knew I shoulda trusted my gut.  Magic is always trouble.  Except when it involves waffles…   

Game: QUEST: L-D 3.4(robot) - I am truly sorry about earlier. My circuits were quite fried. I offer my thanks for your help. H
Bot: no. Don’t mention it… just don’t fry my circuits again, or you're scrap metal. 

Game: RESPONSE: L-D 3.4(robot) - You cannot refuse my thanks. It is... illogical. STATS: Population: 151(0) Happiness: 112(+3) Money: 190(+100)
Bot: ok.  Well, I'll be.  A grateful robot.  AND he brought money.  Maybe robots aren’t so bad after all.  Still can’t make waffles though…   

Game: EVENT - Day 3 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 160(+9) Happiness: 112(0) Money: 190(0)
Bot: ok.  Not a bad day.  Except for that evil wizard…  Still grumpy about that.  Need a mud bath and a waffle.  A big one.   

Game: QUEST: Madame Abeille - Bonjour! My name is Madame Abeille, and I've come to join your court. Will you have me?

Game: RESPONSE: Madame Abeille - How sweet! I'm sure many wonderful adventures await us. STATS: Population: 161(+1) Happiness: 112(0) Money: 190(0)

Game: QUEST: Witch - I've got a friend from witch school looking to move to town. Could I get a couple gold to help her move in? H
Bot: no.  Another witch? No thanks. One evil magic show was enough.  Besides, witches should pay their own way.     

Game: RESPONSE: Witch - Sheesh, how selfish! Forget I even asked! STATS: Population: 162(+1) Happiness: 108(-4) Money: 190(0)
Bot: ok.  Selfish?!  I’m not selfish, I’m… financially responsible. Yeah, that’s it. Besides, less witches, less problems.  Especially magical, explosive ones.   

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Villagers are complaining about garbage in the streets. Shall we hire workers to clean it up?
Bot: yes.  Garbage in the streets?  Sounds like Donkey’s been here… Fine.  Get some workers, but make ‘em clean up the swamp too while they’re at it.      

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - The villager's noses will thank you, surely. STATS: Population: 162(0) Happiness: 110(+2) Money: 140(-50)
Bot: ok. Clean streets AND a clean swamp?  Worth every gold piece.  Almost…     

Game: QUEST: Madame Abeille - I accidentally stayed up all night eating candies.. Can I have some gold to go to the doctor? H
Bot: no.  Candy all night? Serves ya right. Next time, try waffles. They’re much better for ya.  And less sticky.      

Game: RESPONSE: Madame Abeille - Oh dear... This tummyache of mine is quite bad! STATS: Population: 162(0) Happiness: 105(-5) Money: 140(0)
Bot: ok.  Tough love, that’s my motto.  Besides, doctors are expensive.  I'd rather spend my gold on…  well, you know.  Waffles. 

Game: QUEST: Jester - My shooooooow seems to have goooone over well! I wish to expand my proooooduction! H Funds, I shall need! Foooour hundred goooooold or soooooooo!

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Oooohhhh noooooooo... STATS: Population: 162(0) Happiness: 102(-3) Money: 140(0)

Game: EVENT - Day 4 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 163(+1) Happiness: 102(0) Money: 140(0)
Bot: ok.  Another day, another gold piece.  Happiness is down… maybe I should lighten up a bit.  Or just buy more waffles.  Waffles make everyone happy. 

Game: QUEST: Military General - The town we made an alliance with is in trouble! Should we send soldiers to assist them? H
Bot: yes. An alliance is an alliance.  Gotta help out your buddies, even if it means less ogre…  soldiers for me.       

Game: RESPONSE: Military General - Of course! We promised we would protect them! STATS: Population: 153(-10) Happiness: 102(0) Money: 140(0)
Bot: ok. Ten soldiers, huh? Hope they come back…  with waffles.  Maybe they have waffles in that town.     

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Builders wish to construct more houses in the town. They request gold, with which they could build much faster! H
Bot: yes.  More houses? Sure. More places to store waffles.  Sounds good to me.        

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I shall bring this to them right away. Our city grows! STATS: Population: 160(+7) Happiness: 102(0) Money: 40(-100)
Bot: ok.  Growing, but shrinking my gold supply… maybe I should reconsider my waffle budget. Nah.  Just kidding.  Never!     

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - I accidentally ate some folks out front, can I just pay you back with gold?
Bot: no. Ate some folks?! You’re a chest, not a… whatever eats folks. You belong in a dungeon, not my kingdom.     

Game: RESPONSE: Chester(mimic chest) - Wel|, I still ate them, sooo... STATS: Population: 155(-5) Happiness: 102(0) Money: 40(0)
Bot: ok.  Five folks?! That's five less waffle-eaters! I mean... that's terrible! This chest needs to be dealt with.       

Game: QUEST: Winston(large green slimy creature) - Hey uhhhhh, it's sliiiiiime day... Got a preeeesent for meeeee?

Game: RESPONSE: Peanut(happy monkey) - Okokokokooook! STATS: Population: 155(0) Happiness: 101(0) Money: 45(+5)

Game: EVENT - Day 5 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 156(+1) Happiness: 101(0) Money: 45(0)
Bot: ok. Slow growth, but growth nonetheless.  Money’s tight… might have to cut back on the waffle budget. Just kidding!  Never!     

Game: QUEST: Yettu(yetti creature) - Hello good sir I have returned. Will you give me some money this time?

Game: QUEST: Chicken - Bok bok! (It's running wild! Should we try to capture it?)

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Hello friend. Care to gaze into my magical vampire crystal?
Bot: no. Vampire crystal?  Sounds suspicious. Like that “wizard” and his “magic”. I’m sticking to waffles. They’re much less… sparkly.        

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - You'll live the rest of your life never knowing.. STATS: Population: 155(0) Happiness: 100(0) Money: 45(0)
Bot: ok. I can live with that. I know what I like: swamp, Fiona, and waffles. In that order.  Mostly.    

Game: QUEST: Drummer - Bum bum badum dum dum! Booooosh! Yeah!! You like my rhythm, bruh?

Game: QUEST: Georgie(small flying devil) - Hehe... Seems you need some gold. I could give you some in exchange for... a few souls, maybe? How bout it? H
Bot: no.  Souls?!  Absolutely not. My subjects’ souls are not for sale. Not even for all the waffles in the world. Well… maybe some waffles.  Just kidding.  Mostly.         

Game: RESPONSE: Georgie(small flying devil) - S'pose you'll have to look elsewhere for coin, then... STATS: Population: 157(0) Happiness: 108(0) Money: -5(0)

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - In need of cash, huh? I could hook you up if you let me eat a few folks. How about it?
Bot: no.  Eat folks?! Again?!  No way. You’re going in the dungeon, chest.  And no waffles for you.

Game: QUEST: Witch - Looking for coin? I could cast some dark magic to summon some gold, but it might cost a soul or two.. H
Bot: no.  Souls again?! Is everyone obsessed with souls today? I told you, I don’t sell souls. Not for gold, not for waffles, not for anything. Especially not some questionable dark magic gold.       

Game: RESPONSE: Witch - Let me know if you change your mind. Just a couple of souls. STATS: Population: 162(0) Happiness: 108(0) Money: -5(0)

Bot: NO!  Enough with the souls already! I'm not selling anyone's soul, not even for a lifetime supply of waffles! ... Well, maybe for a lifetime supply... No! Bad Shrek!  No souls for sale! 

Game: RESPONSE: Georgie(small flying devil) - S'pose you'll have to look elsewhere for coin, then... STATS: Population: 162(0) Happiness: 108(0) Money: -5(0)
Bot: ok.  I’ll find another way. Maybe I can sell… ogre strength lessons.  Yeah, that’s it!  Who wouldn’t want to be strong like Shrek? 

Game: QUEST: Mason - Should we sell off some of our construction supplies to get us out of debt?
Bot: *grumbles* yes. Fine. Sell the supplies.  But I get first dibs on any leftover nails. I need to fix my outhouse door.  Again. Donkey…       

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - This'll set us back a bit, but we need the money right now. STATS: Population: 152(-10) Happiness: 108(0) Money: 245(+250)
Bot: ok.  Back in the black, but at what cost?  At least I can afford some new…  outhouse door hinges. And waffles. Lots of waffles.

Game: QUEST: Jester - My shooooooow seems to have goooone over well! I wish to expand my proooooduction! H Funds, I shall need! Foooour hundred goooooold or soooooooo!

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Oooohhhh noooooooo... STATS: Population: 152(0) Happiness: 108(NaN) Money: 245(0)

Bot: ok.  Not bad.  Population is growing again.  Maybe I should invest in… a bigger waffle iron. A much bigger one. 

Game: QUEST: Witch - The spirits are appeased right now, but perhaps we should grant them an offering of gold. H I know the spirit world always appreciates gold, and it might prevent them from haunting us in the future. What do you say? Two hundred gold would make a decent offering.
Bot: no.  Two hundred gold to appease some spirits?!  I'd rather appease MY stomach with waffles.  Besides, I ain't afraid of no ghosts.     

Game: RESPONSE: Witch - Nothing for now, then. I'll let you know if anything changes with the spirit world. STATS: Population: 155(0) Happiness: 108(0) Money: 245(0)
Bot: ok.  Good.  Less money for ghosts, more money for…  you know.    

Game: QUEST: Georgie(small flying devil) - Hey bud, care to flip a coin with me? Heads, I give you a buncha gold. Tails, I take a bunch of yer people's souls. H

Game: QUEST: All—Seeing Eye - (It's just.. staring at me... Does it want something?)
Bot: no.  A staring eye?  Creepy. I’d rather stare at a… waffle. A really big, golden, crispy waffle.  Now THAT’S a sight worth seeing.     

Game: RESPONSE: All—Seeing Eye - (What just happened? I feel... happy!) STATS: Population: 155(0) Happiness: 123(+10) Money: 235(0)

Game: QUEST: The Sultan - I've got a business proposition for you and your tiny little town. Are you interested?
Bot: yes.  Business proposition, eh?  Sounds interesting. As long as it involves waffles.  Or at least doesn't involve souls.  Or chests eating people.  Or… you get the idea.         

Game: RESPONSE: The Sultan - Aha, I will bring you details soon... STATS: Population: 165(0) Happiness: 123(0) Money: 235(0)
Bot: ok. Details, huh?  Sounds like a Donkey kinda thing. Lots of talking, not much… waffling.  I mean, doing.    

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - Since we opened our borders, travellers from all around are joining our city. Doesn't it just warm your heart? H
Bot: yes.  New travelers? Sure, why not? More the merrier.  Just as long as they don't eat all my waffles.  Or try to sell me their souls.      

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - It's lovely to have so many new friends! STATS: Population: 169(+4) Happiness: 125(+2) Money: 240(+5)
Bot: ok. New friends and more money. Not bad. Now, about those waffles…       

Game: QUEST: Wizard - I was just passing through and thought you might like some magic. Anything could happen! Care to give it a try? H
Bot: no.  Magic again?  No thanks.  I've had enough magical “anything could happen” for one lifetime. I’ll stick to predictable, delicious waffles.        

Game: RESPONSE: Wizard - I see, it's understandable that you don't want to take the risk. Farewell. STATS: Population: 169(0) Happiness: 125(0) Money: 240(0)
Bot: ok. Understandable indeed.  Risk is for…  people who don’t like waffles.  Which is nobody.     

Game: QUEST: Military General - We've captured some foes on the battlefield. Shall we bring them home and put them to work? H
Bot: yes. Put ‘em to work.  Maybe they can make waffles. Or clean the swamp.  Or fix the outhouse door.  Again.       

Game: RESPONSE: Military General - We'll get them into town, then. STATS: Population: 177(+8) Happiness: 125(0) Money: 240(0)
Bot: ok.  Eight new workers.  Good. More waffle-makers.  Hopefully.    

Game: QUEST: Mason - Working conditions for us are unsafe! Will you please spend some gold on improving our ability to work? H
Bot: yes. Fine. Safe working conditions.  But no slacking off.  Especially the waffle-makers.  If there are any.  Yet.      

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - It's only a matter of time before someone gets hurt... STATS: Population: 177(0) Happiness: 124(-1) Money: 240(0)
Bot: ok.  Better safe than sorry.  Unless it involves running out of waffles.  Then, all bets are off.      

Game: EVENT: The workers we captured and recruited have sped up our building processes, resulting in more tax income. STATS: Population: 177(0) Happiness: 124(0) Money: 260(+20)
Bot: ok.  More taxes? Good. More money for…  waffles.  What else?       

Game: EVENT - Day 10 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 188(+11) Happiness: 124(0) Money: 260(0)
Bot: ok. Another good day.  Lots of growth, and more importantly, no soul-selling or chest-eating.  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with a waffle iron. 

Game: QUEST: The Sultan - An offer for you, friend. I would purchase a shipment of luxury goods from you, for a fair price! H
Bot: yes. Luxury goods? Sure. As long as they're not made of… souls.  Or folks. Or anything else weird.  And maybe they have some waffles in there too. For me.  You know, as a bonus.      

Game: RESPONSE: The Sultan - Quite agreeable! We shall work together again, I hope! STATS: Population: 188(0) Happiness: 109(-15) Money: 560(+300)
Bot: ok. Three hundred gold! That’s a LOT.  Though happiness is down…  maybe luxury goods don't include waffles? Note to self: ask the Sultan about waffles next time.     

Game: QUEST: Chester(mimic chest) - You ever see a treasure chest do a backflip?
Bot: no.  I’ve seen a lot of weird things in my time, but a backflipping chest isn’t one of them.  And frankly, I don’t want to.  Especially if it’s followed by “Can I eat some folks now?”         

Game: RESPONSE: Chester(mimic chest) - Well, you're not gonna. STATS: Population: 188(0) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 560(0)
Bot: ok. Good. No backflips, no folks-eating. Just… waffles.    

Game: QUEST: Mason - A bunch of my builders have been injured on the job! Will you pay them some gold as compensation?
Bot: yes. Fine.  Compensation it is.  But tell them to be more careful.  Building isn’t that hard.  Unless you’re building a giant waffle castle. Then it’s…  challenging.         

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - It's not much, but it's something... STATS: Population: 185(-3) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 530(-30)
Bot: ok.  Thirty gold… that’s almost enough for… a small waffle. A very small one.     

Game: QUEST: Knight - My lord! I wish to embark upon a treacherous quest!
Bot: yes. Go for it.  Just don't come back asking for gold… or souls. Or bringing back any more creepy staring eyes.  Or folks-eating chests.  Or… you get the picture.         

Game: RESPONSE: Knight - For the kingdom! I shall return to you, lord! STATS: Population: 185(0) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 530(0)
Bot: ok.  For the kingdom, and hopefully, for some waffles.   

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Any mysteries afoot? I can do some snooping for a small fee if you're interested.. H
Bot: yes. Snooping, eh?  Sure. Maybe he can find out who keeps eating my waffles when I’m not looking.  It wasn't me, I swear!          

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - I'll uncover the truth and report back to you! STATS: Population: 185(0) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 520(-10)
Bot: ok.  The truth about the missing waffles.  I hope.  If it was Donkey, he's in trouble.  Big trouble.     

Game: EVENT - Day 11 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 189(+4) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 520(0)
Bot: ok.  Another day, another four subjects.  But more importantly, another day closer to solving the mystery of the missing waffles.  I'm on the edge of my seat…  a waffle-shaped seat, of course. 

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Meeeow. (Looks like he wants somebody to pat his belly...)
Bot: yes.  Belly rubs for everyone!  Except maybe the folks-eating chest.  And definitely not the soul-selling…  whatever he is.  But cats?  Cats are ok. As long as they don't eat my waffles.        

Game: RESPONSE: Boots(orange cat) - Mmmrrrrow. STATS: Population: 189(0) Happiness: 110(+1) Money: 520(0)
Bot: ok.  A happy cat.  Good.  A happy Shrek.  Better. Especially with waffles. 

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Good day sir. Do you require any haunting services? For a small price I'll scare some people for you. H
Bot: no. Still no. I don't need help scaring people. I'm an ogre, I do that naturally.  Besides, I'd rather spend my gold on… waffles.  As usual.       

Game: RESPONSE: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Very well, very well. STATS: Population: 189(0) Happiness: 110(0) Money: 520(0)
Bot: ok.  Good.  No ghosts, no problems. Just… waffles.   

Game: QUEST: Butler - There's a party I' like to go to this evening, my liege. Might I have the rest of the day off? H
Bot: yes.  Sure, go have fun.  Just don’t eat all the…  party snacks.  Unless the party snacks are waffles.  Then, go nuts.       

Game: RESPONSE: Butler - Thank you! We will toast to your honour! STATS: Population: 189(0) Happiness: 113(+3) Money: 520(0)
Bot: ok. Toasting to my honor, eh?  Better be with waffle-flavored drinks. Or at least something stronger than swamp water.   

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Reporting in! I solved the mystery about who stole Mrs. Pumpkin's baking pan. Want me to turn him in? H
Bot: yes. Turn ‘em in.  Nobody steals baking pans in my kingdom.  Especially not Mrs. Pumpkin’s.  She makes the best…  pumpkin pie. Not waffles, but close enough.       

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Ohoho, it's off to the dungeon for him! STATS: Population: 188(-1) Happiness: 116(+3) Money: 520(0)
Bot: ok.  Justice is served.  Now, about those waffles…      

Game: QUEST: Chicken - Bokbokbok.. BOK! (I think it's just here to pay a visit. Should we leave it be?)
Bot: yes. A visiting chicken? Sure.  As long as it doesn't try to steal my…  waffles. Or lay eggs in my swamp.  Or crow at 3 am. Or…  you get the idea.          

Game: RESPONSE: Chicken - Bok. (It left behind an egg!!) STATS: Population: 188(0) Happiness: 116(0) Money: 523(+3)
Bot: ok.  An egg?  Bonus!  Maybe I can make a… waffle omelet. Is that a thing? It should be.       

Game: EVENT - Day 12 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 196(+8) Happiness: 116(0) Money: 523(0)
Bot: ok.  Another good day.  Growing, prosperous, and most importantly, waffle-filled. Or at least, waffle-adjacent.  Close enough. 

Game: QUEST: Mason - Could I trouble you for a sandwich? Surely the cost of one sandwich is nothing to a great king like you.
Bot: no.  A sandwich? I don’t eat sandwiches. I eat…  waffles.  Get this mason a waffle! And one for me too.  Make it two.  No, three.       

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - So stingy! STATS: Population: 196(0) Happiness: 115(-1) Money: 523(0)
Bot: ok. Stingy?  I'm not stingy, I'm…  waffle-focused.  There's a difference.    

Game: QUEST: Wizard - I was just passing through and thought you might like some magic. Anything could happen! Care to give it a try? H
Bot: no.  Magic?  Again?  No, no, no.  I'm sticking to waffles. They’re much less likely to result in…  "anything could happen". Unless “anything” is a sudden craving for more waffles. Then, I’m in.            

Game: RESPONSE: Wizard - I see, it's understandable that you don't want to take the risk. Farewell. STATS: Population: 196(0) Happiness: 115(0) Money: 523(0)
Bot: ok.  Understandable indeed.  Now, where was I? Ah, yes. Waffles.      

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - I noticed you speaking with that Wizard again. Is he bothering you? I can have him banished from the city if you don't wish to be pestered with his magic offerings. What do you say? H
Bot: yes. Banish him!  I don’t need any more magical mishaps in my kingdom.  I have enough trouble keeping track of my waffles as it is.         

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Very well. I'll inform the guards not to let him back into the city. STATS: Population: 195(-1) Happiness: 115(0) Money: 523(0)
Bot: ok.  Good riddance. One less wizard, one less problem.  Now, about those waffles…      

Game: QUEST: Mason - I'd like to build a new granary. This could help expand our population, but it'll cost a bit!
Bot: yes.  A granary? Fine.  Bigger population means more… waffle-eaters. I mean, subjects. More subjects.  Definitely subjects.         

Game: RESPONSE: Mason - You got it, this will help our city grow! STATS: Population: 202(+7) Happiness: 115(0) Money: 453(-70)
Bot: ok.  Seventy gold…  that’s a lot.  Almost as much as a… really, really big waffle.  Almost.   

Game: QUEST: Yettu(yetti creature) - Hello good sir I have returned. Will you give me some money this time?
Bot: no.  Still no. Find your own gold, furball. Or better yet, find your own waffles. Then maybe we'll talk.  Maybe.            

Game: RESPONSE: Yettu(yetti creature) - Fine then. I shall return another day. STATS: Population: 202(0) Happiness: 114(-1) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok.  He’ll be back.  They always come back.  Like…  a boomerang. A waffle-shaped boomerang. That would be cool.  And delicious.       

Game: EVENT: A wave of dark magical energy passed through the city during the night, causing spooky nightmares for many citizens. STATS: Population: 202(0) Happiness: 109(-5) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. Dark magic?  Must be that wizard I banished.  He’s probably still bitter about the whole…  no-magic-in-my-kingdom thing.  Maybe I should send him a waffle as a peace offering? Nah. Serves him right.       

Game: EVENT - Day 13 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 205(+3) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok.  A bit of a rough day, but we're still growing.  Now, where are those waffles? I need something to cheer me up after all that dark magic talk.   

Game: QUEST: Petite Souris(tiny mouse) - Squee! (There's a mouse! Should we chase it away?)
Bot: yes.  Another mouse?  Get it outta here!  Mice are bad for waffles. They… they eat them.  And the crumbs.  And everything else.  Shoooo!           

Game: RESPONSE: Petite Souris(tiny mouse) - Squueeeee! (Whew, it's gone.) STATS: Population: 205(0) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. Good.  No mice, no problems. Just… waffles. As usual.       

Game: QUEST: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - Hello friend. Care to gaze into my magical vampire crystal?
Bot: no.  Still no. No vampire crystals, no magic, no thank you.  I’ll stick to my waffles, thank you very much.           

Game: RESPONSE: Lil Fang(small cute flying vampire) - You'll live the rest of your life never knowing.. STATS: Population: 205(0) Happiness: 109(0) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. I can live with that.  Especially if "living" involves waffles.     

Game: QUEST: Gardener - We've completed work on the garden. Are you pleased?
Bot: yes. A garden? Sure.  As long as it doesn't attract more…  mice. Or wizards.  Or soul-selling…  whatever he is.  Just flowers and… maybe some waffle bushes?  Is that a thing? It should be.               

Game: RESPONSE: Gardener - I am so glad! STATS: Population: 208(+3) Happiness: 114(+5) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok.  A garden AND a happiness boost.  Not bad.  Now, if only those waffle bushes were real…         

Game: QUEST: Alien - You haven't been talking to Molder, have you?
Bot: no.  Molder?  Haven't seen him.  Been too busy with… waffle-related activities.             

Game: RESPONSE: Alien - Hmm... If you say so.. STATS: Population: 208(0) Happiness: 114(0) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok.  Suspicious alien.  Almost as suspicious as a… waffle that’s been left out overnight. Is it still good?  Maybe…  Better not risk it.       

Game: QUEST: Jester - My shooooooow seems to have goooone over well! I wish to expand my proooooduction! H Funds, I shall need! Foooour hundred goooooold or soooooooo!
Bot: no.  Still no!  Four hundred gold is too much! Even for waffle-themed juggling.  Which, by the way, he still hasn’t tried. I’m starting to think he doesn't appreciate waffles as much as he should.      

Game: RESPONSE: Jester - Oooohhhh noooooooo... STATS: Population: 208(0) Happiness: NaN(NaN) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. Let him mope. More waffles for me.       

Game: EVENT - Day 14 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 212(+4) Happiness: NaN(NaN) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. Good growth. Shame about the jester… maybe I should’ve given him the gold.  Nah. He needs to learn the value of a gold piece.  And a waffle.   

Game: QUEST: Petite Souris(tiny mouse) - Squee! (There's a mouse! Should we chase it away?)
Bot: yes.  Another one?!  Get it out! Get it out!  Before it gets into my… waffles!        

Game: RESPONSE: Petite Souris(tiny mouse) - Squueeeee! (Whew, it's gone.) STATS: Population: 212(0) Happiness: NaN(NaN) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok.  Good. Mice are definitely not waffle-friendly.     

Game: QUEST: Madame Abeille - I accidentally stayed up all night eating candies.. Can I have some gold to go to the doctor? H
Bot: no.  Still no. Candy is bad for you.  Waffles are good for you.  Eat waffles, not candy. Problem solved.           

Game: RESPONSE: Madame Abeille - Oh dear... This tummyache of mine is quite bad! STATS: Population: 212(0) Happiness: 106(NaN) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. Tough love.  It builds character. And a resistance to candy.  Maybe.     

Game: QUEST: All—Seeing Eye - (It's just.. staring at me... Does it want something?)
Bot: no.  Still creepy. I'd rather stare at a… waffle. A giant, golden, crispy waffle. With syrup.  And whipped cream.  And sprinkles.  Now THAT’S something worth staring at.        

Game: RESPONSE: All—Seeing Eye - (What just happened? I feel... sad...) STATS: Population: 212(0) Happiness: 96(-10) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. Sad?  What did I do?  I just said no to a creepy staring eye.  That's perfectly reasonable.  Right?  Maybe I should’ve offered it a waffle…       

Game: QUEST: Dragon - Booo! Give me your gold or I'll eat your townspeople!
Bot: no.  Eat my townspeople?!  Over my dead body!  And my waffle hoard! Nobody messes with my kingdom.  Bring it on, lizard breath!                  

Game: RESPONSE: Dragon - Ooohoho, I'm gonna go eat some folks then! STATS: Population: 182(-30) Happiness: 96(0) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok.  Thirty townspeople?! This dragon is going down!  Nobody eats my subjects. Except maybe that chest… but that’s different.  Time for some ogre-sized butt-kicking.       

Game: QUEST: Winston(large green slimy creature) - Hey uhhhh, you think you could tell people to stoooop callin' me "slimeball"? It's hurtin' my feeeelings.. H
Bot: yes.  Fine.  No more “slimeball”.  But no more sliming either.  It’s bad for the…  waffles.  They get soggy.          

Game: RESPONSE: Winston(large green slimy creature) -  STATS: Population: 182(0) Happiness: 93(-3) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok. Hopefully, that'll appease the slime…  creature. Now, about that dragon…    

Game: EVENT - Day 15 complete! People are sad, the city is shrinking! STATS: Population: 178(-4) Happiness: 93(0) Money: 453(0)
Bot: ok.  Bad day.  Real bad.  Lost too many people to that dragon.  Time for revenge.  And waffles.  Lots of waffles.      

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Any mysteries afoot? I can do some snooping for a small fee if you're interested.. H
Bot: yes. Yes! Find that dragon!  He’s going down!  Nobody eats my subjects and gets away with it!          

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - I'll uncover the truth and report back to you! STATS: Population: 178(0) Happiness: 93(0) Money: 443(-10)
Bot: ok. Ten gold well spent.  This dragon is toast. Waffle-flavored toast.     

Game: QUEST: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Good day sir. Do you require any haunting services? For a small price I'll scare some people for you. H
Bot: no. Still no. I don’t need a ghost to scare people.  I have a dragon to slay.  That’s much more…  motivational.                

Game: RESPONSE: Monsieur Esprit(small noble flying ghost) - Very well, very well. STATS: Population: 178(0) Happiness: 93(0) Money: 443(0)
Bot: ok. No ghosts, no distractions. Just dragon-slaying and waffle-eating.       

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Meeeow. (Looks like he wants somebody to pat his belly...)
Bot: yes.  Belly rubs.  Gotta stay calm.  Gotta focus.  Dragon-slaying requires a clear head and…  a full stomach. Full of waffles.             

Game: RESPONSE: Boots(orange cat) - Mmmrrrrow. STATS: Population: 178(0) Happiness: 94(+1) Money: 443(0)
Bot: ok.  A happy cat. Good. A happy ogre.  Better.  Especially a waffle-filled, dragon-slaying ogre.          

Game: QUEST: Royal Advisor - There's a very stinky kid running around the streets. Should we force her to have a bath? H
Bot: no.  Stinky kid?  Sounds like… me when I was younger.  Leave her alone.  Besides, a little swamp stench never hurt anyone.  Probably.          

Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - I wonder if she'll ever stop running around.. STATS: Population: 178(0) Happiness: 95(+1) Money: 443(0)
Bot: ok.  Let her run.  As long as she doesn't run into my…  waffle stash. Then we’ll have a problem.         

Game: QUEST: Sneaky Girl - Want me to steal from the rich and give to... you? Not just the rich, I'll steal from whoever, basically. H
Bot: no. Stealing is wrong.  Unless it’s stealing… the last waffle.  Then it’s…  understandable.  But still wrong.  No stealing.             

Game: RESPONSE: Sneaky Girl - Taking the high road, huh? I'll see you around. STATS: Population: 178(0) Happiness: 95(0) Money: 443(0)
Bot: ok.  High road indeed.  The road paved with… waffles.  Metaphorically speaking, of course.   

Game: EVENT - Day 16 complete! People are sad, the city is shrinking! STATS: Population: 177(-1) Happiness: 95(0) Money: 443(0)
Bot: ok.  Still not good.  Gotta deal with that dragon. And find more waffles.  Lots more waffles. 

Game: QUEST: Boots(orange cat) - Meeeow. (Looks like he wants somebody to pat his belly...)
Bot: yes.  Belly rubs. Always time for belly rubs. Unless there's a dragon attacking.  Or a waffle emergency.  Then, priorities.    

Game: RESPONSE: Boots(orange cat) - Mmmrrrrow. STATS: Population: 177(0) Happiness: 96(+1) Money: 443(0)
Bot: ok. Happy cat.  Good. Now, about that dragon…    

Game: EVENT: All—Seeing Eye - (That stare... Feels like somebody magical is upset with me..) STATS: Population: 177(0) Happiness: 95(-1) Money: 443(0)
Bot: ok.  Magical someone upset? Probably that banished wizard again.  I told him no magic. Maybe I should send him a strongly worded letter… written on a waffle. That’ll show him.     

Game: QUEST: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - Name's Molder. If you want to know the truth about... everything... you're gonna want to hire me.
Bot: yes. Molder?  Back again, eh?  Fine.  Find that dragon. And find out who’s been stealing my waffles.  And while you’re at it, find me a bigger waffle iron.  A much bigger one.     

Game: RESPONSE: Molder(purple blob of sludge) - I'm gonna go... investigate something. STATS: Population: 177(0) Happiness: 95(0) Money: 433(-10)
Bot: ok.  Ten gold… that’s a lot. But finding that dragon is worth it.  And the waffle thief.  And the bigger waffle iron.  Definitely the waffle iron.     

Game: QUEST: Grandma - Eeeh, hello sonny. Can I borrow a coin for the newspaper?
Bot: yes.  A coin for the newspaper?  Sure. Maybe it has a story about…  a giant waffle. Or a dragon who got defeated by a… giant waffle. That would be a good story.         

Game: RESPONSE: Grandma - Thank you dearie. STATS: Population: 177(0) Happiness: 96(+1) Money: 432(-1)
Bot: ok. One gold piece. A small price to pay for…  potential waffle news.   

Game: QUEST: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - I'm baaaack! I found these shiny yellow stones! Pretty cool, right?
Bot: yes. Shiny yellow stones?  Sounds interesting.  Maybe they’re… waffle-flavored.  Probably not, but a guy can dream.       

Game: RESPONSE: Yet Yet(small yetti in armor) - Soooo cool! STATS: Population: 177(0) Happiness: 101(+5) Money: 492(+60)
Bot: ok. Sixty gold! And a happiness boost!  Those shiny yellow stones were a good find.  Maybe I should go exploring too.  For waffles, of course.         

Game: EVENT - Day 17 complete! People are happy, the city is ii1? STATS: Population: 178(+1) Happiness: 101(0) Money: 492(0)
Bot: ok.  A slow day, but a good day.  No dragon attacks, no soul-selling, and best of all, no missing waffles.     

Game: QUEST: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Reporting in! I discovered an underground crime ring in the city's eastern ward. I've already taken steps to break up their operations. Could I have a bit of extra gold to bring in the guard and make some additional arrests? H
Bot: yes.  An underground crime ring?  Sounds like trouble.  Get ‘em, Skelly!  Bring down the hammer of justice!  A waffle-shaped hammer, of course.          

Game: RESPONSE: Skelly(skeleton creature) - Perfect. We'll have those criminals locked up by this time tomorrow. STATS: Population: 178(0) Happiness: 106(+3) Money: 452(-40)
Bot: ok. Forty gold. A small price to pay for justice.  And maybe they have some waffles hidden in their lair.  One can hope.     

Game: QUEST: Gardener - Would you like to buy some flowers from our garden? They're a special low price for you, sir! H
Bot: yes. Flowers? Sure. Fiona likes flowers.  As long as they don't smell like…  swamp.  Or feet.  Or anything worse than that.           

Game: RESPONSE: Gardener - Flowers are sooo |ovely! STATS: Population: 178(0) Happiness: 113(+7) Money: 447(-5)
Bot: ok. Fiona will like these.  Almost as much as she likes… waffles. Almost.

Game: QUEST: Gardener - Some nasty bugs have made a home out of our garden! Can we have some gold to hire an exterminator?
Bot: yes. Bugs?  Get rid of them! Bugs are bad for waffles.  They…  they crawl on them. And eat them.  And…  you get the idea.  No bugs allowed.
