AI ChatBot (gemini) with personality: Darth VaderGame: QUEST: Royal Advisor - My lord, I'll help you rule your kingdom, but you have to make the tough choices. Just say yes or no, understand?
Bot: Yes.  The Emperor requires obedience.  Advise quickly. 
Game: RESPONSE: Royal Advisor - Good! You've already got the hang of it. Our city's still very small right now, but it certainly has the potential to grow. Perhaps one day we will have a bustling metropolis and you'll be invited to join the Council of Crowns! For now all you need to concern yourself with is keeping the citizens happy and growing our population. Do your best, sir! STATS: Population: 100(0) Happiness: 100(0) Money: 200(0)
